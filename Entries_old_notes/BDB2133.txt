Source text issue. Line 22 has "Jr 1 R 22,18" which is confusing -- the English source has "je 1Kgs 22:18" where "je" appears to be a garbled abbreviation for Jeremiah. The correct reference is Jr 22,18. The "1 R" was carried over from the malformed source. "preparatory" IS translated as "préparatoire". Mostly false positive; source text extraction error, not a translation error.
