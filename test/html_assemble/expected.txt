# Expected results for html_assemble test suite
# Format: filename  expected_status
# Statuses: CLEAN (output matches expected HTML), ERRATA (bad txt_fr, should be caught)
#
# CLEAN entries need an Entries_fr_expected/*.html file.
# ERRATA entries have deliberately bad Entries_txt_fr/ and need no expected HTML.
