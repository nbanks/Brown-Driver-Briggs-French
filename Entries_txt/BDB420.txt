2Kgs 9:18;
2Kgs 9:19
סֹב אֶלאַֿחֲרַי turn to behind me, Zech 6:5 (where אֶל is pleonastic,
probably due to clerical error; note יצא אל before & after); אֶלבֵּֿין
in between
Ezek 31:10
;
Ezek 31:14

אֵלבֵּֿינוֺת similarly Ezek 10:2
׳
אֶלמִֿבֵּית לְ

׳
שָׁמָּה אִמְרִילִֿי וג; Num 33:54
׳
אֶלאֲֿשֶׁר וג; Prov 17:8 (compare Deut 16:6); — אֶל appears to be used by a species of
attraction; the idea of motion involved in the relative clause influencing illogically the beginning of the
sentence
and causing אֶל to be used instead of בְּ. In Deut 31:14
אֵלֵיהֶם, as pointed, can only be from אַיִל III or IV (q. v.); if the word be
taken as the Pronoun with suffix (Hi
Ke), אֲלֵיהֶם must be read.

Note. 2. — There is a tendency in Hebrew, especially manifest in Samuel Kings Jeremiah Ezekiel, to
use
אֶל in the sense of עַל; sometimes אֶל being used
exceptionally
in a phrase or construction which regularly, and in accusative with analogy, has עַל;
sometimes,
the two prepositions interchanging, apparently without discrimination, in the same or parallel sentences. Thus (
a)
Josh 5:14
וִיִּפֹּל אֶלפָּֿנָיו; 1Sam 13:13
אֶתמַֿמְלַכְתְּךָ אֶליִֿשְׂרָאֵל

צָלַח אֶל, 1Sam 10:6 and elsewhere צָלַח עַל; 1Sam 25:17 evil is determined

אֶלאֲֿדֹנֵינוּ וְעַל כָּלבֵּֿיתוֺ; 1Sam 25:25; 1Sam 27:10; 2Sam 2:9

Ezek 18:6;
Ezek 18:11

Ezek 21:12 etc. Ps 79:6 (Jer 10:25
על twice). It is probably that this interchange, at least in many cases, is not original, but
due
to transcribers.

[Note]

Conversely, though not with the same frequency, עַל occurs where analogy would lead us to expect
אֶל, or even in juxtaposition with אֶל, as 1Sam 1:10
הִתְפַּלֵּל עַל to pray to (1Sam 1:26
אֶל);
1Sam 1:13;
1Sam 25:25
