1. the living chariot of the theophanic God; possibly identified with the storm-wind Ps 18:11 = 2Sam 22:11
וַיִּדְכַּב עַלכְּֿרוּב

2. as the guards of the garden of Eden Gen 3:24 (
J
).

׳
י
Yahweh Sabaoth throned on the cherubim
1Sam 4:4; 2Sam 6:2 = 1Chr 13:6 the
context shews that the cherubim of the ark of the covenant are referred to, and it is probable that the same
reference to, and it is probable that the same reference is in 2Kgs 19:15 = Isa 37:16; Ps 80:2; Ps 99:1.

4. P gives an account of:

a. two cherubim of solid gold upon the slab of gold of
the כַּפֹּרֶת facing each other with wings outstretched above, so as to constitute a basis or
throne on which the glory of Yahweh appeared, and from whence He spake Exod 25:18-22; Exod 37:7-9;
Num 7:89

b. numerous cherubim woven into the texture of the inner curtains of the tabernacle and the
veils Exod 26:1
;
Exod 26:31;
Exod 36:8; Exod 36:35

5. Kings and Chronicles describe the cherubim of the temple:

a.
two gigantic images of olive wood plated with gold, ten cubits high, standing in the דְּבִיר
facing the door, whose wings five cubits each, extended, two of them meeting in the middle of the room
to
constitute the throne, two of them extending to the walls 1Kgs 6:23-28; 1Kgs 8:6;

2Chr 3:10-13;
2Chr 5:7;

Chronicles (doubtless influenced by Ezekiel) represents them as the chariot of Yahweh
1Chr 28:18

b. images of cherubim were carved on the gold plated cedar planks which constituted the
inner
walls of the temple, and upon the olive wood doors 1Kgs 6:29-35 2Chr 3:7 and on the bases of the portable lavers,
interchanging with lions
and oxen 1Kgs 7:29
-36; Chronicles also represents that they were woven in the veil of the דְּבִיר
2Chr 3:14.

6. Ezekiel describes the cherubim:

a. as four living creatures, each with
four
faces, lion, ox, eagle, and man, having the figure and hands of men, and the feet of calves. Each has four
wings,
two of which are stretched upward, meeting above and sustaining the throne of Yahweh; two of them stretched
downwards so as to cover the creatures themselves. The cherubim never turn but go straight forward, as do the
wheels
of the cherubic chariot, and they are full of eyes and are like burning coals of fire, Ezek 1:5-28; Ezek 9:3; Ezek 10:1;

Ezek 11:22

the king of Tyre is scornfully compared with one of these, and is assigned a residence in Eden and the mountain
of
God Ezek 28:14
-16;

b. Ezekiel knows of no cherubic statues in the new temple, but represents the
inner
walls of the temple as carved with alternating palm trees and cherubim, each with two faces, the lion looking on
one
side, the man on the other. It is evident that the number and the form of the cherubim vary in the
representations
(compare
Ezek
41:18-25). It is probable that the שְׂרָפִים of Isa 6:2-6 are another form of the cherubim. The
Apocalypse of the seals Rev 4-6 combines them in four ζῷα.
