Biblical Hebrew

דַּי
substantive
sufficiency, enough (Late Hebrew, but not known in other cognate languages) — construct
דֵּי, with suffix (see below) דַּיֶּ֑ךָּ, דַּיָּם: —

1. absolute thrice only Mal 3:10 I will pour you out a blessing עַדבְּֿלִידָֽֿי until
there is not sufficiency, i.e. until my abundance can be exhausted, or, as this can never be,
for ever (compare Ps 72:7
), Esth 1:18

וּכְדַי בִּזָּיוֺן וָקָ֑צֶף and (there will be) as enough (i.e. in plenty)
contempt and wrath,
2Chr 30:3
לְמַדַּי = לְמַהדַּֿי for what was sufficient. With a
genitive of the person or thing for which anything suffices: Exod 36:5
מִדֵּי הָעֲבֹדָה (more) than enough for the work, Lev 5:7 and if his hand do not reach (if he
do not command) דֵּי שֶׂה
enough for (i.e. to buy) a lamb, Lev 12:8; Lev 25:28
דֵּי הָשִׁיב לוֺ
enough for recovering it, Deut 15:8
דֵּי מַחְסֹרוֺ
enough for his need, Isa 40:16 (twice in verse). With suffix Prov 25:16
אֱכֹל דַּיֶּ֑ךָּ eat that which is sufficient for thee; דַּיָּם

Exod 36:7; Jer 49:9; Obad 1:5. Once with
genitive of the thing which is sufficient, Prov 27:27
דֵּי חֲלֵב עִזִּים
enough of goats' milk.

2. Combined with בְּ, כְּ, and especially מִן,
דַּי (דֵּי) has a tendency to form compound prepositions, used idiomatically in
certain applications: —

a.
בְּדֵי (α) for (the בְּ
pretii) what suffices for:
Nah 2:13 the
lion
tare in pieces בְּדֵי גֹרוֺתָיו
for the need of his whelps (|| לְלִבְאֹתָיו; but ? כְּדֵי
,
see b.); iron. Hab 2:13; Jer 51:58 the peoples labour בְּדֵיאֵֿשׁ
for fire (only to satisfy the fire), and the nations weary themselves בְּדֵירִֿיק

for what is empty. (β) in the abundance of, i.e.
as often as Job 39:25
בְּדֵי שׁוֺפָר
in the abundance of the trumpet, i.e. as often as the trumpet sounds (מִדֵּי

elsewhere in this sense).

b.
כְּדֵי
according to the sufficiency, or abundance, of
Lev 25:26
and
find כְּדֵי גְאֻלָּתוֺ
according to the sufficiency of his redemption, i.e. as much as it
demands, Deut 25:2
;
Neh 5:8
כְּדֵי בָנוּ (stative construct before בְּ: Ges^«GKC:130»§ 130^, 1) 'quantum in nobis erat,' after our
ability,
Judg 6:5 they came
כְּדֵי אַרְבֶּה לָרֹב
according to the abundance of the locust in multitude (for which כָּאַרְבֶּה
לָרֹב
would ordinarily be said: compare Judg 7:12).

c.
מִדֵּי
out of the abundance of, hence as often as; — (α)
followed
by infinitive 1Sam 1:7

מִדֵּי עֲלֹתָהּ = as often as she went up, 1Sam 18:30; 1Kgs 14:28 (= 2Chr 12:11
)
2Kgs 4:8; Isa 28:19
מִדֵּי עָבְרוֺ
as often as it passeth over, Jer 31:20 (β) followed by substantive, Jer 48:27
מִדֵּי דְבָרֶיךָ בּוֺ
as often as thy words (are) of him; and in the idiomatic phrases מִדֵּי שָׁנָה
בְּשָׁנָה = yearly (a combination of מִדֵּי שָׁנָה and

שָׁנָה בְּשָׁנָה: see below שָׁנָה) 1Sam 7:16 (see Dr
) Zech
14:16;
2Chr 24:5 and
מִדֵּי חֹדֶשׁ
בְּחָדְשׁוֺ
Isa 66:23
as often as month (comes) in its month (i.e. in its own time: חֹדֶשׁ
made
more precise by the add. of בְּחָדְשׁוֺ; compare the phrase דְּבַר יוֺם בְּיוֺמוֺ

): so מִדֵּי שַׁבָּת בְּשַׁבַּתּוֺ
ib.; (γ) as conjunction, with the finite verb (אֲשֶׁר being
understood: compare בַּעֲבוּר etc.), Jer 20:8
מִדֵּי אֲדַבֵּר
as often as I speak.
