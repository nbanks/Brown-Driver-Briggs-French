Biblical Hebrew

דגן (√ of following meaning dubious; Late Hebrew דַּגֵּן Pa`el heap up
etc. seems to be denominative; Ol^§ 215 b. 4^ derives
דָּגָן from דָּגָה, compare MV; We^Skizzen iii. 170^ inclines to regard דָּגָן as
derived from proper name, of divinity דגן (compare דָּגוֺן), as cereal
from Ceres).
