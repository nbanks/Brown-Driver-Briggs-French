Biblical Aramaic

אֵלֶּה demonstrative pronoun plural
these (Nabataean אלה (Lzb^264^

Cooke^241^), Cappadocian and Egyptian Aramaic אלה
(Lzb^Eph. i. 323^
RÉS^361 A 3^
S-C^Pap. E.13, Ki 13^): probably therefore not, as used to be
supposed, a Hebraism, but a peculiarity of the dialects of Jer 10:11 and of Ezra (in which the usually Aramaic form
אִלֵּין does not occur) : see further אִלֵּין); — these,
