Josh 1:4 (

=
2Chr 1:17
(both +
מַלְכֵי אֲרָם), 2Kgs 7:6 (+ מַלְכֵי מִצְרַיִם, both feared by אֲרָם
). Hence it appears that הַחִתִּי (םׅ had their proper seat in the north — where also
they
were encountered by Assyrians from time of Tiglath-Pileser I (see
Schr^^

Dl^1. c^.), and by Egyptians from time of Tutmes III (see
W Max Müll.^l.c.^) — (compare also Judg 3:3; Josh 11:3 above), but that individual
Hittites were known in Israel (compare, besides 1Sam 2:6; 2Sam 11:3 etc., 1Kgs 9:20 above); that the Hittites were regarded (by

J

E

D
) as one of the peoples of Canaan, and that the name even came to be used in more general sense for
Canaanites. Only in
P
do they appear as having a definite settlement in the south, and are designated by בְּנֵיחֵֿת
(see
חֵת
), as well as by the adjective הַחִתִּי.
