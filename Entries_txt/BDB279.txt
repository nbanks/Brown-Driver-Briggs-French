Biblical Hebrew

אַחְלַי
Ps 119:5 and
אַחֲלֵי
2Kgs 5:3 (perhaps
from אָח III. and לַי = Aramaic לְוַי = ׃לוּ the
varying punctuation is due doubtless to the word being treated by the punctuators as a substantive = wish
, with suffix & in construct stative, 'my wish is that,' etc.; compare
Ki on Ps 119
תְּחִנּוֺתַי וּבַקָּשׁוֺתַי), ah that! (

ᵐ5

ο[φελον).
