Biblical Hebrew

I. אלה (assumed as √ of אֵל, (אֱלוֺהַּ) אֱלֹהִים
god, God, but question intricate, & conclusions dubious It is uncertain whether
אֵל & אֱלֹהִים are from the same √. Following are the chief theories:

1.

a.
Thes makes אֵל & אֱלֹהִים
distinct,
and both really primitive, but associates אֵל in treatment with אֵל
strong, Participle of √ אול; strong, according to
Thes, being derived from meaning be in front of
;
(different order in Lex. Man., Rob-Ges);

b.
אֵל & אֱלֹהִים distinct; former from אול
strong; latter plural of אֱלֹהַּ from √ [אלהּ] =
[placeholder210: Placeholders/210.gif] (
[placeholder211: Placeholders/211.gif]) go to and fro in perplexity or fear, hence אֱלֹהַּ
fear & object of fear, reverence, revered one
;
[placeholder212: Placeholders/212.gif] = פחד אל
trepide confugere ad
Hos 3:5
אלהים = פחד
Gen 31:42 =
מוֺרָא
Isa 8:13
De^Gn 1887,48^ (compare σέβασμα, post-Biblical
Hebrew
יִרְאָה
NHWB; Aramaic דַּחֲלָא CWB); so De following Fl in De^Gn ed. 4, 57^, compare MV
.

2.
אֵל & אֱלֹהִים possibly connected; אֵל =
leader,
lord, from √ אול
be in front; so Nö^MBAk 1880, 760 f; SBAk 1882, 1175
f.^

3.

a.
אֵל & אֱלֹהִים connected, & both from a √ אלה (=

אלהּ) to which is assigned meaning strong; so
Ew^§ 146 d, 178 b (see also Jahrbücher d. bibl. Wiss. x. 11, Bibl. Theol. ii. 330)^;

b.
אֵל from √ אלה
strong (not אלהּ), & אֱלֹהִים expanded from
אֵל
, compare plural אֲמָהוֺת from אמה etc.; so Di on Gen 1:1 he supports meaning strong by reference to phrase
יֵשׁ לְאֵל יָדִי
Gen 31:29
and
elsewhere;

c. similarly, אֵל, being very early & common Shemitic word,
formed plural אלהים, from which singular אֱלוֺהַּ was afterwards inferred,
Nes^Theol. Stud. a. Württ., 1882, 243^ (criticized by Nö^SBA 1.c^.).

4.
אֵל (אֱלוֺהַּ, אֱלֹהִים disregarded) from √ אלה

stretch out to, reach after (compare preposition אֵל, אֱלִי

, also אָלָה
swear), God as the one whom men strive to reach, 'das Ziel aller
Menschensehnsucht und alles Menschenstrebens,' Lag^Or. ii. 3; Gn 1882:173 =
M
96^. — compare Spurrell^Hebrew Text of Genesis, App. ii^, where all these views
are
stated somewhat more fully, & briefly criticized; on the use of אֵל & אֱלֹהַּ
in Shemitic languages see, exhaustively, Nö^MBAk, SBAk, 1.c^
.).
