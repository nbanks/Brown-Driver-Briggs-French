Σ(ε)ινα. Identification dubious; local tradition names Jebel Musa
, mountain at southern end of peninsular between the two arms of Red Sea, so Rob^BR i. 90 ff., especially 119-122^ compare Stanley^Sinai and
Pal. 42 f. and elsewhere^, specifically its northern spur,
Ras ‚afƒâfeh
; but Lepsius^Briefe 345 ff., 416 ff.^
Eb^GS especially 392 ff.^ and others advocate Serbal
, northwest from Jebel Musa (on tradition, cf
Eb^ib. 413 ff.^); see discussion Di^
Exod 19:1
^. Against both is the working of Egyptian mines in the peninsula as late as the 19th dynasty (see
Eb^GS 135, 148 ff., 159, etc.^), involving presence of soldiers
there. This, and connection with Midian (compare also Judg 5:5), have led to search for Sinai further northeast, near head of Gulf
of Akaba, or even in Seir, so Say^Monuments 263 ff.^, compare
GFM^
Judg 5:5; Judg 6:1
^ and Yakut, cited by Id^179 n. §^, also see Gall^Altisr.
Kultst. 12^; on sanctity of the mountain see further RS^Sem i. 110 f.,
