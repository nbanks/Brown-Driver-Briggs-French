Biblical Aramaic

ו

וְ, וּ
conjunction
and (Biblical Hebrew וְ), used mostly as in Hebrew, except that there is no
ו 'consecutive'; — and, connecting both words (Dan 2:5) and sentences (ib.
). When three or more words are connected together, וְ may connect them all (Dan 2:6; Dan 2:10; Dan 4:34; Dan 5:18), or only
the two last (Dan 2:17
; Dan 3:4; Dan 4:4; Ezra 6:9), or the
three last (Dan 2:37
; Dan 3:21),
or be omitted altogether (Dan 2:27; Dan 5:11, compare Dan 3:2; Ezra 4:9). וְ also connects verbs, in cases where Biblical Hebrew
would use וַּ , as Dan 4:2; Dan 5:29; Dan 6:17; Dan 6:25 in such cases a Perfect is often followed by a
Participle, as
Dan 2:7
עֲנוֺוְאָֽמְרִין, so Dan 2:10; Dan 3:9; Dan 3:16; Dan 3:24 +, hence in Dan 2:5; Dan 2:8; Dan 2:15; Dan 2:20 and often read probably with Nö^GGA
1884, 1021^
עֲנָה וְאָמַר (for עָנֵה). Special senses: —

a.
and that
Dan 4:10; Dan 4:12; Dan 4:20; Ezra 6:8; Ezra 6:9 (compare
Dan 2:16; Dan 2:18);
and also
Dan 6:29 =
with, Dan 7:1.

b. connecting contrasted
ideas, but
Dan 2:6; Dan 3:6; Dan 3:18; Dan 4:4.

c. = and so, Dan 2:49; Dan 6:2, especially after imperative Dan 2:4; Dan 2:9; Dan 2:24, or imperfect Dan 2:7.

d. to express an intention Dan 5:2
וְיִשְׁתּוֺן
that they might drink: after a command, etc., even with participle or perf., nearly =
that, Dan 2:13; Dan 6:2 (compare K^§ 102^).

e. introducing the predicate (compare Biblical Hebrew 5.c
.), Dan
7:20
וְקִרְנָא דִכֵּן וְעֵינַיִם לַהּ and this horn, it had eyes; but
the case is isolated, and del, probably וְ with Marti.
