, Gen

Exod 5:10
אֵינֶנִּי נֹתֵן לָכֶם תֶּבֶן
I am not giving you straw; and so often with particip. where duration has to be expressed
Gen 39:23; Deut 21:18; Isa 1:15; Jer 7:16, or
intention Gen 20:7

Treated as a mere particle of negation, אֵין may vary its position in the
sentence, the substantive which should strictly stand in the genitive being not only separated from it by a little
word, as בּוֺ
Gen 37:24,
לוֺ
Exod 22:1,
שָׁם
Exod 12:30,
גַּם
Ps 14:3, etc., but
even for emphasis prefixed to it, as Gen 19:31; Gen 40:8
וּפֹתֵר אֵין אֹתוֺ
Gen 41:15; Exod 5:16; Judg 13:9; Judg 14:6; Judg 16:15; Judg 19:1 (so

MI^24^
): if however it be thus brought to the end of a sentence, or be disconnected with what follows, it stands
in the absolute form, as Gen
2:5
ואדם אַיִן לעבד האדמה and man there was none to till the ground, Lev 26:37
וְרֹדֵף אָ֑יִן
Num 20:5; 2Kgs 19:3; Hos 13:4; Mic 7:2. d.
sometimes the subject has to be supplied from the context: thus (α) 1Sam 9:4 and they passed through the land of

with subject not expressed, once (late), Dan 8:5
וְאֵין נֹגֵעַ בָּאָרֶץ and (it) was not touching the earth. feminine
once, Job
35:15 with the finite verb; but read here כִּי אֵין פֹּקֵד (the usage of
[placeholder180: Placeholders/180.gif], cited by De, does not justify the anomaly in Hebrew)
Jer 38:5 the
imperfect may be due to the fact that no participle of יָכֹל was in use, and a relation must be
tacitly supplied: 'The king is not (one that) can do aught against you.' On Exod 3:2 see Ges^«GKC:52»§ 52^, 2 R. 6; Ew^§ 169
d.^
