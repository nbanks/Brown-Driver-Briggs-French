Biblical Hebrew

כהן (√ of following; meaning dubious, see Dr^
2Sam 8:18
^; Arabic verb
[placeholder2456: Placeholders/2456.gif] is divine, and
[placeholder2457: Placeholders/2457.gif] (Qor 52:29) is a seer, the organ (mostly) of a jinn, rarely of a god: the
[placeholder2458: Placeholders/2458.gif] and the כֹּהֵן must have been originally identical (both alike being guardians
of an oracle, at a sanctuary); but their functions diverged: the
[placeholder2459: Placeholders/2459.gif] gradually lost his connection with the sanctuary, and sank to be a mere diviner; the כהן
acquired fuller sacrificial functions: see RS^Enc. Brit. ed. 9, xix.
727^; We^Skizzen iii. 130 ff.^, 167; Now^Archaeology ii. 89 f.^; Phoenician כהן is
priest, כהנת
priestess).
