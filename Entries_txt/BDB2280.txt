Gen 22:9 by Issac at Beersheba Gen 26:25 by Jacob at Shechem Gen 33:20 (yet this perhaps mistake for מַצֵּבָה

1Chr 22:1 that
Solomon sacrificed on the altar at Gibeon 1Kgs 3:4 and built altars in the temple at Jerusalem 1Kgs 6:20; 1Kgs 8:64 that Jeroboam built an altar at
Bethel 1Kgs 12:32
(which was destroyed by Josiah 2Kgs 23:15); and that Elijah repaired an ancient altar on Carmel 1Kgs 18:30. An
altar in Egypt is predicted Isa 19:19. All this accords with the law of the Covenant code Exod 20:24-26
which recognises a plurality of altars and prescribes that they shall be built of אֲדָמָה, or of
unhewn stones, and without steps. So אֲבָנִים
Deut 27:6 (
J

E
), אֲבָנִים
שְׁלֵמוֺת
Josh 8:31, and
twelve stones 1Kgs
18:30;
1Kgs 18:32 compare Isa 27:9. The altar was also a place of refuge Exod 21:24 (
J

E
) 1Kgs 1:50
; 1Kgs 1:51
; 1Kgs 2:28.

D
prescribes one central altar Deut 12:5f. 27; but no attempt to enforce this principle appears before Hezekiah(
2Kgs 18:4; 2Kgs 18:22),
and Josiah, whose reform is more effectual, 2Kgs 23:8-20.

3. P limits sacrifices to the altars of the tabernacle. A great altar was built east of the Jordan,
but it was according to

11. ministry at the altar was ׳
מִשְׁמֶרֶת הַמּ

compare Num 3:31 (

P
), ׳
מְשָֽׁרְתֵי מ
Joel 1:13

(compare יָרַד

sacrifices were usually offered עַלהַֿמִּזְבֵּחַ
Gen 22:9; Deut 12:27 +;
see especially the phrases with זָרַק
Exod 29:16;
Exod 29:20 +

Gen 8:20 (

J
) Num
23:2;
Num 23:4;
Num 23:14;
Num 23:30 (

); one touching the altar is ׳
הַנֹּגֵעַ בַּמּ
Exod 29:37
(

); ׳
לפני המ of placing, or standing before altar Deut 26:4; 1Kgs 8:22
as accusative of location
הַמִּזְבֵּ֫חָה in phrases especially with הִקְטִיר
Exod 29:13
+, and הֶעֱלָה
Lev 14:20

12. the horns of the altar were especially for the application of the blood of the
sin-offering in the ritual; sin is represented as graven לְקַרְנוֺת מִזְבְּחוֺתֵיכֶם

therefore of blood for cleansing it was said ׳
נָתַן על קרנות המ
Exod 29:12
; Lev 4:7;
Lev 4:18;
Lev 4:25;
Lev 4:30;
Lev 4:34;
Lev 8:15;
Lev 9:9; Lev 16:18
(all
P
). An ancient custom is referred to, Ps 118:27
אִסְרוחַֿג
בַּעֲבֹתִ֑ים עַדקֿרנות המזבח
bind the festal victim with cords, unto the horns of the altar: Ainsworth
paraphrases: 'that is, all the court over, untill you come even to the hornes of the altar, intending hereby
many sacrifices,' so De; but Che
'bind the procession with branches, (step on) to the altar-horns,' that is in sacred procession
round the altar.

13. the
יְסוֺד
(q. v.) is also referred to in the ritual of the sin-offerings in the phrases יָצַק אל

אל יסוד

14. the altar was קֹדֶשׁ קָדָשִׁים
Exod 29:37
; Exod
40:10 (
P
); but repeated sin-offerings were necessary to keep it pure and cleanse it from the pollution of
the people in whose midst it was situated. This is expressed by חִטֵּא
Lev 8:15 (

P
)
Ezek 43:22
כִּפֶּר
Lev 16:20
; Lev
16:33 (
P
)
