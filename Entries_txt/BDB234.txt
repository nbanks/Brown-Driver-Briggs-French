2Chr 8:18 gold,
almug- (sandal-?) wood & gems 2Chr 10:11 (twice in verse), compare 2Chr 9:10 probably 1Kgs 10:22 reference to same ships;
they came once in three years with gold, silver, ivory, apes & peacocks (all from Ophir ?); 2Chr 9:21 makes these ships go to
Tarshish (but on Tarshish-ships, i.e. large, sea-going vessels, merchantmen, see 1Kgs 22:49 & below
תַּרְשִׁישׁ).

4. hence for fine gold itself Job 22:24 (|| בֶּצֶר). — (If 2 = 1,
then southern, probably south-eastern, Arabia (compare Di
Gen 10:29)
furnished the gold; and other articles, which point farther east (e.g. to India, toward which the words
קוֺפִים
apes & תֻּכִּיִּים
peacocks seem to lead), were either brought to Ophir by traders, & so found there by
Solomon's men, or were found elsewhere by the latter, whose cruise may have taken them beyond Ophir, the name of
Ophir alone, as source of gold-supply, being preserved. If (less likely) 1 & 2 are
not the same, the only data for determining location of 2 are the articles brought, & one may
look toward India, Ceylon or other islands, or even lower Africa. Particular theories have as yet no adequate
support; e.g. (a) old city Supara, or Uppara, in
the region of Goa, Malabar coast (compare

above 2, but also 1; form with Σ said on Coptic authority to
denote India, see Jablonskii^Opusc. ed. te Water i. 337^; compare also
Jos^Ant. «JOSEPHUS:Antiquities 8:6»viii. 6^. 4; in that case its use by

may indicate a theory of the location of Ophir); (b) peninsula Malacca
; (c) island Sumatra; (d)
Sofâla, with city Zimbabye (southeast Africa); (e) west coast of Arabia (where
gold & silver formerly found), etc. On these & other theories, see Di

Gen 10:29
