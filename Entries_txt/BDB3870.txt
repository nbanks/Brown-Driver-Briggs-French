before tone-syllable כָּ, as כָּזֶה, כָּאֵ֫לֶּה,
כָּחֵ֫מָּה; with suffix כָּכֶם
Num 15:15 + 7 t.
(Job 16:4

כָּהֶן

8; compare Arabic
[placeholder2383: Placeholders/2383.gif],
[placeholder2384: Placeholders/2384.gif], etc.], before light suffix, in the form
כְּמוֺ
(q. v.), namely כָּמֹנִי, כָּמוֺנִי
Gen 44:15 + 16
t., כָּמוֺךָ
Gen 41:39 + 28

Judg 8:18; Ps 115:8; Ps 135:18.
Prop. an undeveloped substantive, capable of standing in any case and followed (like
[placeholder2385: Placeholders/2385.gif]) always by a genitive, as 1Sam 20:3
כפשׂע
׳
כ for there is (nominative) the like of a footstep (Arabic
[placeholder2386: Placeholders/2386.gif]) between me and death, Gen 41:38
הנמצא כזה shall be we find (accusative) the like of this one ? (see
especially Fl^Kl. Schrr. i. 376 ff.^ Mühlau, in Bö^ii. 64 f.^, with many Arabic examples; also W^AG i. § 356 R. c.; ii. § 63^
Ges^«GKC:118»§ 118^. 6; compare, for both usage and construction,
the Latin instar: this view criticized by
Kö^ii. 1, 279 ff.^, who treats כְּ as demonstrative adverb); but Hebrew
having no case-endings, its proper sense was doubtless forgotten, and כְּ became practically
equivalent to a preposition like, as: —

1.

a.
quantitatively (like the Arabic
[placeholder2387: Placeholders/2387.gif]
measure, number, size, of . . . :
[placeholder2388: Placeholders/2388.gif]
as many as 100), to express exact or approximate equality, in the latter case
the
like of is = about:
Deut 1:11
Yahweh
add to you ככם אלף פעמים
the like of you (
Saad

[placeholder2389: Placeholders/2389.gif]) 1000 times (compare 2Sam 24:3), Exod 12:37
כשׁשׁ מאוֺת אלף רגלי
the like of (i.e. about) 600,000 footmen, Exod 32:28
כשׁלשׁת אלפי אישׁ, Josh 4:13; Josh 7:3; 1Sam 9:22; 1Sam 25:38
ויהי כעשׂרת הימים (nomin.) and there was the like of (= about
) 10 days, and, etc. Ruth 2:17
כאיפה שׂערים, etc., compare כַּמָּה
the like of what ? = how many ? (see
מָה
); as accusative of space or time, Num 11:31
כדרך יום
the like of a day's journey, Josh 3:4; Josh 10:13
כיום תמים
about a whole day (Arabic
[placeholder2390: Placeholders/2390.gif]),
Ruth
1:4
כעשׂר שׁגים. So (as adverb accusative) with words denoting a point of
time:
often with עֵת, as כָּעֵת הַזּאֹת literally at the like of

this time = about this time, Josh 11:6 and elsewhere, כָּעֵת
מָחָר at the like of the time, (being) to-morrow = about
to-morrow, Exod 9:18 +, כָּעֵת חַיָּה (see חי), Isa 8:23
כעת הראשׁין
at the former time, כָּעֵת alone = at the
(present)
time, now
Num 23:23;
Judg 13:23;
Isa 23:5
(unusual)
כְּשֵׁמַע צֹר; so כְּהַיּוֺם, כַּיּוֺם (see
יוֺם

7.h.), כִּמְעַט, כְּרֶגַע; and especially
with
infinitive, see 3.b.

b.
qualitatively (like Arabic
[placeholder2391: Placeholders/2391.gif]
likeness of . . .), to express resemblance in respect of some attribute, action,
character, appearance, etc.: so very often; as subject of a sentence, Num 9:15
כמראה
אשׁ
the like of (= as it were) an appearance of fire was, etc.
(compare Ezek 1:4
; Ezek
1:26 a.;
Ezek 1:27; Dan 8:15; Dan 10:18),

Dan 23:22

accusative)
Judg 13:23; Judg 15:7; Judg 20:30; Lev 10:19 + (see
זֹאת
, אֵלֶּה). Cases such as to give or reward a man כמעשׂהו,
כרעתו, etc., the like of his doings, etc., 2Sam 3:39; 1Kgs 8:32;
Ps 18:25
; Ps 28:4
, to speak כדבר הזה or כדברים האלה
Gen 18:25
; Gen
24:28 + often, form the transition to

c. as an accusative of mode or
limitation, in or with the like of (= like, as
according to, κατά); — (1) expressing conformity to a standard or rule: Gen 1:26 let
us make man כדמותנו
according to our likeness, Gen 9:3; Josh 19:47; Judg 20:10; 1Sam 13:14 hath looked out

דַּק כַּכְּפוֺר, Song 6:10
יָפָה כַלְּבָנָה, compare Gen 13:10 a verb Ps 7:3
פֶּןיִֿטְרֹף כְּאַרְיֵה, Ps 19:6
יָשִׂישׂ כְּגִבּוֺר, Isa 42:13, etc.; with the tertium compare
. attached in a relative clause, Deut 32:11
בַּנֶּשֶׁר יָעִיר קִנִּי
like the great vulture, (that) stirreth up its nest, Job 9:26; Job 11:16; Isa 61:10

like the bride, who putteth on, etc., Isa 62:1
כְּלַפִּיד יִבְעַר
like a touch (that) burns (on the presence or absence of the article in such cases,
see הַ
1.f.), Ps 42:2; Ps 83:15 (below 2.d.) + often (compare
Dr^§ 34:^

כְּ is not in these cases to be construed as a conjunction [ =
כַּאֲשֶׁכ] with the verb: see De^Ps
38:14^
Ges^«GKC:155»§ 155^, 2 b, 1 R.).

d. sometimes כְּ is used in particular to compare an
object with the class to which it belongs, and express its
correspondence with the idea which it ought to realize: Isa 13:6 ( =
Joel 1:15) of the ׳
יום י, כְּשֹׁד מִשַּׁדֵּי יָבוֺא i.e. it comes as a
veritable, or ideal, destruction from Shaddai,

Isa 29:2 of Ariel (Isa 29:1) והיתה לי כאריאל i.e.
shall be to me as a true Ariel (compare
Ges^«GKC:118x»§ 118x^): so also, according to
Hi
De, Isa 10:13; Ezek 26:10; Zech
14:3; 2Sam
9:8; Ps
122:3;
Song 8:10 (see De), Eccl 10:5; Neh 7:2. The older
grammarians called this the Kaph veritatis (a translations of Ki's
כף֞ הָאֲמִתּוּת, כף֞ לאמת הדבר,
Michl^45 a (Lyck)^, Comm^

Josh 3:4; 1Sam 9:13; Isa 1:7; Hos 5:10,
^ or כף֞ הָאֲמִתִּי, Lexicon under the word יוֺם):
they extended it unduly (e.g. to Num 11:1; Lam 1:20;
Hos 11:4).

2. repeated, כְּכְּ֗֗֗, to signify the completeness of the correspondency
between
two objects (peculiar to Hebrew):

a. in a principal clause, Gen 18:25
וְהָיָה כַצַּדִּיק בָּרָשָׁע literally that the like of the righteous be
the like of the wicked, i.e. that the righteous be as the wicked,
Gen 44:18
כמיך כפרעה
the like of thee is the like of Pharaoh, i.e. thou
art as Pharaoh, Lev 24:22
כַּגֵּר כָּאֶזְרָח יִהְיֶה, 1Kgs 22:4
כָּמֹנִי כָמוֺךָ כְּעַמִּי כְעַמְּךָ (Van Dyck
[placeholder2393: Placeholders/2393.gif]),
Hag
2:3
הֲלוֺא כָמֹהוּ כְּאַיִן בְּעֵינֵיכֶם is not the like of it
the
like of nothing in your eyes ? i.e. is it not like nothing in your eyes ? Ps 139:12
כַּחֲשֵׁיכָה כָּאוֺרָה i.e. the darkness (to thee) is as the light.
Usually
the first term is the subject and the second is the standard with which it is compared: but occas. the terms are
inverted, as Lev 7:7
;
Num 15:15;
Judg 8:18
כמוך כמוהם (Van Dyck
[placeholder2394: Placeholders/2394.gif]),
Hos
4:9; Isa
24:2
, compare
Isa
59:18
Note, below)

b. in a subordinate clause (to be regarded as
subordinated
in the accusative to the principal verb); (α) attached to the subject of the
principal verb,
Lev
24:16
כגר כאזרחי֗֗֗ומת he shall be put to death, the like of the stranger
(being)
the like of the homeborn, Josh 8:33. (β) attached to its object
,
Deut 1:17
כקטן כגדל תשׁמעון literally ye shall hear (them), the like of the small
(being) the like of the great.

c. occasionally, for
כְּכְּ֗֗֗
, there occurs ׃בְּו֗֗֗כ
Josh 14:11
כְּכֹחִי אָז וּכְכֹחִי עָ֑תָּה
the like of my strength then, and the like of my strength now,
i.e.
they are similar (compare וְ
1.j.) 1Sam 30:24; Ezek 18:4; Dan 11:29.

d. yet
more distinct
than כְּכְּ֗֗֗, is כְּכֵּ֗֗֗ן; in a nominal sentence (Ges^«GKC:140»§ 140-1^), 'כְּ with its
genitive forming the predicate, and כֵּן resuming it with emphasis and connecting it
with
the subject;'
1Sam 25:25
כִּי כִשְׁמוֺ כֶּןהֿוּא for the like of his name,
such
(or so) is he, Gen 44:10; Josh 2:21; Jer 18:6; Ps 48:11; Ps 127:4

; Prov
10:26 +; in a verbal sentence, 'כְּ preceding, as an accusative of state, and
giving the secundum comparationis, and כֵּן resuming it,' Joel 2:4
כפרשׁים כן ירוצון 'instar (accusative) equitum, sic
currunt' (Fl^l.c^.), Hos 4:7 literally
with
(or in) the likeness of their multiplying, so
they sinned against me, Gen 6:22; 1Sam 8:8; Isa 38:14; Ezek 22:22; Ps 42:2;
Ps 83:15
+ often

3. before an infinitive:

a.
like (literally with or in the likeness of . . .
), Judg
14:6

כְּשַׁסַּע הַגְּדִי
like the rending of a kid, i.e. as when a kid is rent (by a lion),
2Sam 3:34;
Isa 5:24; Ps 66:10;
Ps 68:3; Job 2:10, etc.;
=
as if, Isa 10:15 or shall the saw magnify itself against him that wieldeth it

כהניף שׁבט אתמֿרימיו
with the like of a staff's shaking (= as if a staff were to shake)
him
that lifted it !

b. of time, about, at, whether of the past or of
the
future: Gen 19:17

כהוציאם
אותם
at their bringing them forth, i.e. as or when

they brought them forth Gen 24:30; Gen 29:13; Gen 39:10; Gen 39:13 + very often; of the future, Gen 44:30;
Gen 44:31;
Deut 20:2; Deut 20:9; 2Sam 13:28
+; Isa 28:20
b (different from Isa 28:29 a)
and the covering is (too) narrow when one gathers oneself in. Occasionally with the
verbal
noun, Hos 13:6
כמרעיתם
at the time of their feeding, Isa 30:19
כְּשָׁמְעָתוֺ; וּכְחֶזְקָתוֺ
2Chr 12:1;
2Chr 26:16
;
Dan 11:2 (
Ew^§ 238 a, 239 a^): compare Isa 23:5b כְּשֵׁמַע צֹר
. With the
participle Gen
38:29
(si vera lectio), perhaps Gen 40:10 compare Dr^§ 135. 6^
,
Obs. 2.

Note. — כְּ is rarely prefixed to prepositions, the only examples which occur
being
the idiomatic כְּבָרִאשֹׁנָה, Judg 20:32; 1Kgs 13:6; Isa 1:26; Jer 33:7; Jer 33:11
כְּבַתְּחִלָּה in the || clause Isaiah l.c.; כְּבַחֲצִי
1Sam 14:14
(apparently corrupt); כְּמִשְׁלשׁ חֳדָשִׁים
Gen 38:24
(and
probably כְמֵחֹדֶשׁ
1Sam 10:27

ᵐ5

); כְּמִפְּנֵי
Lev 26:37
כְּעַל (late):

a. pleon. for כְּ (עַל =
according to), Isa 63:7
כְּעַל כָּלאֲֿשֶׁר עָשָׂה, Isa 59:18, כְּעַל גְּמֻלוֺת כְּעַל יְשַׁלֵּם
the like of their deeds is the like of (that which) he will repay
(ellipse of rel., as Job 34:32, etc.);

b. = as over
Ps 119:14
,
= as concerning
2Chr 32:19
.
Where logically a preposition would seem to be required after כ, it is in Hebrew regularly
omitted
(Ges^«GKC:118»§ 118^. 3 R), the nature of כְּ
, as
explained above, not in fact admitting it; thus Isa 1:25 I will purge away thy dross כַּבֹּר [not,
as in English,
like as with lye, but] (with) the like of lye (כ
being an accusative defining the mode in which אצרף takes place); Isa 5:17
כְּדָבְרָם in English as in their pasture, Judg 20:39
כְּיוֺם as in day of, Isa 9:3; Ps 95:8 +, כִּימֵי
Job 29:3 who
will
set me as in the days of old ! Isa 51:9 +, כְּנֹקֶף זַיִת as at
,
etc., Isa 17:6
: so
with לְ
Ps 83:10;
Job 29:23,
על
Job 30:5.

כְּ is used also pregnantly with substantives, Ps 18:34 who meketh my feet like hinds

(for like the feet of hinds), Isa 29:4; Isa 63:2
בגדיך כדורך בגת, Jer 50:9; Job 40:9 and elsewhere compare Ges^§§ 118.
6;
141. 2 R. n.^
