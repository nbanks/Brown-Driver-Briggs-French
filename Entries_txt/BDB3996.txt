Biblical Hebrew

כִּי עַל כֵּן
forasmuch as, a peculiar phrase found Gen 18:5; Gen 19:8; Gen 33:10; Gen 38:26; Num 10:31; Num 14:43; Judg 6:22; 2Sam 18:20

Qr
(rightly), Jer 29:28; Jer 38:4 — literally for therefore, emphasizing the ground
pleonastically (Ew^§ 353 a^ ). The original force of the phrase is
traceable in some of the passages in which it occurs, as Gen 18:5 let me fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort your heart;
כִּיעַֿלכֵּֿן עֲבַרְתֶּם
עַל עַבְדְּכֶם
for therefore (that is, to partake of such hospitality) are ye come to your servant, Num 14:43 the
Amalekite and the Canaanite are there, and ye will fall by the sword, כִּיעַֿלכֵּֿן שַׁבְתֶּם
for therefore (to encounter such a fate) have ye turned back from ׳
י etc.: but in process of time the distinct sense of its component parts was no doubt gradually
obscured, and it thus came to be used conventionally, as a mere particle of causation, even
where there was no preceding statement to which עַל כֵּן
therefore could be explicitly referred. אֲשֶׁר עַל כֵּן appears to be used
similarly (compare אֲשֶׁר
8.c.) Job 34:27.
