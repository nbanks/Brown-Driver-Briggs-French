kallâtu
, explanation by Dl^Prol. 130 f.^ (compare
Id^HWB 330^) as proposing closed bridal chamber (ideogram = closed
chamber), from √ כלא or כלה, thence bride
(compare harem); according to RS^K 136 f. 292^

כַּלָּה = one closed in, or reserved (that is, for
her husband); Ges and others one crowned (compare
Aramaic etc. כלילא
crown), but form much against this; Nö^ZMG 1886, 737^
'ventures no explanation').
