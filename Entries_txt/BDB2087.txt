singular], he, she, used also (in both genders) for the neuter it, Latin

Moabite and Phoenician inscriptions, though dropped in some of the later dialects. [In Hebrew only Jer 29:23

(see Krae^BAS. i. 383 & references^,
W^SG 98, 105^
Dl^§ 55b, 57^). In the Pentateuch, הוא is of
common gender, the feminine form הִיא occurring only 11 times, namely Gen 14:2; Gen 20:5; Gen 38:25 (see Masora here), Lev 11:39; Lev 13:10; Lev 13:21; Lev 16:31; Lev 20:17; Lev 21:9; Num 5:13; Num 5:14. The
punctuators, however, sought to assimilate the usage of the Pentateuch to that of the rest of the OT, and
accordingly wherever הוא was construed as a feminine pointed it הִוא (as a

Qr
perpetuum
). Outside the Pentateuch the same
Qr
occurs
1Kgs 17:15; Isa 30:33; Job 31:11a — probably for the sake of removing gramm. anomalies: five instances of
the converse change, namely of היא to be read as הוּא, occur for a similar reason,
1Kgs 17:15 (
וַתּאֹכַל הוּאוָֿהִיא to be read as וַתּאֹכַל הִיאוָֿהוּא, on account of the
feminine verb) Ps
73:16; Job
31:11b (כי הוא זמה והיא עָוֺן
פלילים to be read as כי היא זמה והוא עון פלילים), Eccl 5:8; 1Chr 29:16. The origin of the
peculiarity in the Pentateuch is uncertain. It can hardly be a real archaism : for the fact that arab., Aramaic,
& Ethiopic have distinct forms for masculine & feminine shews that both must have formed part of the
original Semitic stock, and consequently of Hebrew as well, from its earliest existence as an independent language.
Nor is the peculiarity confined to the Pentateuch: in the Manuscript of the Later Prophets, of A.D. , now at St.
Petersburg, published in facsimile by Strack (1876), the feminine occurs written הוא (see the
passages cited in the Adnotationes Criticae, p. 026). In Phoenician both masculine and
feminine are alike written הא (CIS i. 1Chr 1:9
מלך צדק הא, 1Chr 1:13
מלאכת הא, 1Chr 3:10
אדם הא, 1Chr 1:11
ממלכת הא,

1Chr 93:2;

1Chr 94:2),
though naturally this would be read as

hu°
or
hi°
as occasion required. Hence, as

ᵐ5

shews that in the older Hebrew
MSS
. the scriptio plena was not yet generally introduced, it is probably that
originally הא was written for both genders in Hebrew likewise, and that the epicene הוא
in the Pentateuch originated at a comparatively late epoch in the transmission of the text — perhaps in
connection with the assumption, which is partly borne out by facts (compare
De^ZKWL 1880, pp. 393-399^), that in the older language feminine forms were more sparingly
used than subsequently.)

In usage הוּא (feminine הִיא; plural הֵ֫מָּה, הֵם
, ׃ הֵ֫נָּה see
הֵ֫מָּה
) is

circumstantial
clauses see Dr^§ 157, 160, 168, 169^.) And where the predicate
is a
substantive or participle, Gen 2:11
הוּא הַסֹּבֵב ֗֗֗
that is the one which encompasseth etc., Gen 2:13 Gen 2:14; Gen 10:12
that is the great city. So in the explanatory notices, Gen 14:3
הוּא יָם הַמֶּלַת
that is the salt sea, Gen 14:8
הוּאצֹֿעַר
that is Zoar, Gen 36:1 + often

b. pointing back to the subj. and contrasting
it with something else :
Gen

הבל גסהֿוא Abel, he also … Gen 4:26; Gen 10:21; Gen 20:5
וְהִיאגַֿםהִֿוא and she, herself also said, Exod 1:10 + often

c.
appended alone to a verb (more rarely, but always with intentional emphasis), Exod 4:14 I know
כי דבר ידבר הוא that he can speak, Exod 4:16; 1Sam 22:18
ויפגע הוא בכהנים and he (though none else would do it) smote the
priests,

2. It resumes the subject with emphasis:

a. when the predicate is a
verb (especially if it be separated from its subject by an intervening clause), Gen 15:4 but one
that shall come
forth out of thine own bowels, הוּא יִירָשֶׁ֑ךָ
he shall be thy heir, Gen 3:12 the woman whom thou gavest to be with me, הוא נתנה לי
she gave to me, Gen 24:7; Gen 44:17 etc. Judg 7:4; 2Sam 14:19 (throwing stress on יוֺאָב) 1Chr 11:20
; Isa
33:15-16
; Isa 34:16
;
Isa 38:19;
Isa 47:10;
Isa 59:16;
Isa 63:5; Hos 7:8 often in
Proverbs, as

Hos 10:18;

Hos 10:22;

Hos 10:24;

Hos 11:28;
Hos 13:13;

Hos 19:21;

Hos 22:9;

Hos 24:12;
1Sam 1:13 (see
Dr), Ps 68:36.

b. when the predicate is a noun
, Gen 2:14
and the fourth river, הוּא פְרָת
it was the Euphrates, Gen 2:19; Gen 9:18; Gen 15:2; Gen 42:6
הַשַּׁלִּיט וְיוֺסֵף הוּא and Joseph, he was the ruler etc.: in
sentences of
the type הוּא הָאֱלֹהִים

4:35
; Deut 7:9;
Deut 10:9; Josh 13:14;
Josh 13:33;
Isa 9:14; Isa 33:6;

(in these cases, to avoid stiffness, it is convenient often to drop the pronoun in
translating, as 'And the fourth river was the Euphrates:' the pronoun, however, though it
then corresponds to the substantive verb in English, does not really express it, the
copula,
as the examples shew, being in fact understood. Sts. in
AV
the pronoun is retained for emphasis, as Deuteronomy ll. cc.) So

c.
after אֲשֶׁר in an affirmative sentence, Gen 9:3 all creeping things

אֲשֶׁר הוּאחַֿי which are living, Lev 11:39; Num 9:13; Num 14:8; Num 35:31
אֲשֶׁר
הוּא רָשָׁע לָמוּת who is guilty of death, Deut 20:20; 1Sam 10:19; Hag 1:9 and elsewhere (On 2
, compare Dr^§ 199^, with Obs.)

3. Where, however, the pronoun follows the predicate, its position gives it the
minimum of emphasis, and it expresses (or resumes) the subject as unobtrusively as possible: thus

a.

Gen 12:18
why
didst thou not tell me כי אשׁתך
הוא that she was thy wife ? Gen 20:13; Gen 21:13
כי זרעך
הוא for he is thy seed, Gen 31:20 because he told him not כִּי בֹרֵחַ הוּא, Gen 37:3 + often
(the
opposite order rare and emphatic: Gen 24:65; Deut 4:6; Deut 30:20; Josh 10:2; 1Kgs 2:22; 1Kgs 3:4; 1Kgs 21:2; Hos 2:4; Ps 45:12).

b. resuming the subject, Gen 31:16 all
the wealth which
God hath taken etc., לנו הוא ולבנינו
it is ours and our children's, Gen 31:43 and all that thou seest, לי הוא
it is mine (or, omitting the pronoun, as not required in our idiom, simply) is
mine, Gen
41:26
חלום פרעה אחד
הוא the dream of Pharaoh is one, Gen 48:5 (לי הם), Exod 3:5 for the
place where on thou
standest, אַדְמַת קֹדֶשׁ הוּא
it is holy ground, Num 13:32; Num 21:26; Deut 1:17; Josh 5:15; Josh 6:19; Job 3:19 + often; Gen 23:15
ארץ ֗֗֗ מַההִֿוא, so Ps 39:5; Isa 41:22 (הֵנָּה); הֵמָּה ….
אַתֶּם
(unusual)
Zeph 2:12. (In all such cases the predicate is not referred directly to the subject, but, the subject
being made a casus pendens, it is resumed by the pronoun, and the predicate thus referred to it indirectly. By
this
means the sentence is lightened and relieved, especially if the subject consist of many words: in Gen 31:16 for
instance, the direct form of predicate כִּי לָנוּ
וּלְבָנֵינוּ כָּלהָֿעשֶׁר אֲשֶׁר הִצִּיל אֱלֹהִים מֵאָבִינוּ would have been heavy and
inelegant.)
So

c. after אֲשֶׁר in a negative sentence, Gen 7:2; Gen 17:12
אֲשֶׁר לאֹ
מִזַּרְעֲךָ הוּא which is not of thy seed, Num 17:5; Deut 17:5; 1Kgs 8:41 (compareהֵמָּה
3.c.).

d. peculiarly, as the subject of לֹא,
Jer 5:12

לוֺא הוּא
He is not; and as embracing its predicate in itself, Isa 18:2; Isa 18:7 a nation
terrible
מִןהֿוּא (= מַאֲשֶׁר הוּא) from (the time that) it was
,
Nah
2:9
מִימֵי הִיא from the days that (stative construct

followed
by a participle or substantive Gen 27:33; Ps 24:10
מִי הוּא זֶה מֶלֶךְ הַכָּבוֺד who is he, then — the king of glory ? (according to others, as
before, 'Who (emphatic), then, is the king of glory ?'); followed by a verb Isa 50:9
מִי הוּא יַרְשִׁיעֵנִי who is he (that) will condemn me ? (others 'Who
(emphatic) will condemn me ?') Job 4:7; Job 13:19; Job 17:3; Job 41:2; Jer 30:21 (so with הֵנָּה

5. As an emphatic predicate, of God, 'I am He,' i.e. I am He Who is

to unreal gods, named in context, or to transitory world), the Unseen, yet Omni-present, and Self-consistent,
Ruler
of the world,
Deut

אֲנִי אֲנִי הוּא I, I am he, and beside me there is no God, Isa 41:4 (see
Che) Isa 43:10; Isa 43:13 even from to-day I am he,

Ps 102:28

(see Che) thou art he, and thy years have no end
