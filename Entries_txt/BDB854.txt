not exclusively) 1 Ki 20 — 2 Ki 8, & in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, e.g. 1Kgs 20:25 (but 1Kgs 20:23

Dl^Pr 115^

KAT^2. 498^; but compare
Nö^ZMG '86, 738 f.^). Not found as yet in the other cognate languages: but compare
Ethiopic
[placeholder470: Placeholders/470.gif] 'enta, towards, which supports the view; that אֵת
is for 'int [compare תֵּת, תִּתִּי], perhaps from √
אנה
to meet
Ol^p. 431^
Prät^ZMG '73, 643^
Lag^M i. 226^).

c.
beside = in the presence of (rare): Gen 20:16b and before

אֶתפְּֿנֵי פּ is more frequently, see below פָּנִים

אוֺת)

; Gen

אִתּוֺ] Jer 5:5; Jer 12:1; Ezek 2:1; Ezek 3:22; Ezek 3:24; Ezek
3:27;
Ezek 14:4; Ezek 44:5 — all -אוֺת); Gen
24:49 to perform kindness אֵת (עִם is here more genl.),

2Sam 16:17
זֶה חַסְדְּךָ אֶתרֵֿעֶךָ֑, Ruth 2:20;

וְאַתָּה עשֶֹׁה אִתִּי רָעָה, Deut 1:30; Deut 10:21; 1Sam 12:7
b, (-אוֺת) Jer 21:2; Jer 33:9; Ezek 7:27; Ezek
16:59; Ezek 22:14; Ezek 23:25; Ezek 23:29; Ezek
39:24 absolute Ezek 17:17; Ezek 20:44; Ps 109:21; Zeph
3:19 (γ) in a pregnant sense, (in dealing) with, i.e.
towards (rare): Isa 66:14; Ps 67:2
יָאֵר פָּנָיו אִתָּנוּ make his face to shine with (=
toward) us (varied from אֶל
Num 6:25
)
Deut 28:8 faithful with

(compare
Ps 78:37
נָכוֺן עִם); Ezek 2:6 (אוֺתָ֑ךְ); Judg 16:15
וְלֹבְּךָ אֵין אִתִּי. (δ) often with verbs of fighting, striving,

;

Judg 4:11
אֲשֶׁר אֶתקֶֿדֶשׁ which is near Kedesh, 1Kgs 9:26; 2Kgs 9:27 (compare
עם
2, which is commoner in this sense); Ezek 43:8; Exod 33:21
הִנֵּה מָקוֺם אִתִּי. Perhaps, anomalously, 1Sam 7:16
at or by all those places (but see Dr
); in 2Sam
15:23
עַלפְּֿנֵי דֶרֶךְ אֶתהַֿמִּדְבָּר, אֵת = towards is
against
analogue: read with

ᵐ5

^L^

עַלפָּֿנָיו דֶּרֶךְ הַזַּיִת אֲשֶׁר בַּמִּדְבָּר; 1Kgs 9:25
אִתּוֺ
beside it (that is, the altar); but עָלָיו
1Kgs 13:1
etc.
would be idiomatic, & for אִתּוֺ אֲשֶׁר
Klo proposes plausibly אֶתאִֿשֹּׁוֺ (see Exod 30:20
).

3.
׳
אֵת פּ denotes specially,

a. in one's possession or keeping: Gen 27:15
; Gen 30:29
thou
knowest אֵת אֲשֶׁר הָיָה מִקְנְךָ אִתִּי ֗֗֗ how thy cattle fared with
me,
Gen 30:33
; Lev 5:23
; Lev
19:13;
Deut 15:3;
Judg
17:2; 1Sam 9:7

מָה אִתָּנוּ = what have we ?

my right
is with Jehovah (contr. Isa 40:27), Jer 8:8; Ps 38:11 the light of mine eyes also
אֵין אִתִּי i.e.
is gone from me,
Prov
3:28;
Prov
8:18 in his power, Jer 10:5
הֵיטֵיב
אֵין אוֺתָם is not in their power, perhaps Ps 12:5. A dream, or the word of

׳
י, is said to be אֵת
with a prophet, 2Kgs 3:12; Jer 23:28; Jer 27:18. Metaph. of a mental quality, Prov 11:2;
Prov 13:10
.

b. in one's
knowledge or memory: Isa 59:12
פְּשָׁעֵינוּ אִתָּנוּ our transgressions are with us, i.e. present
to our
minds (|| וַעֲוֺנֹתֵינוּ יְדַעֲנוּם), Job 12:3
אֶתמִֿיאֵֿין כְּמוֺאֵֿלָּה
with whom are not (i.e. who knoweth not ? τίς οὐ
σύνοιδε;) things like these ? Job 14:5
אִתָּךְ i.e. known to thee, Prov 2:1; Gen 40:14; Jer 12:3 (Ew

Gf
towards thee, as 1.d.γ.). So
אִםיֵֿשׁ אֶתנַֿפְשְׁכֶם
Gen 23:8
[
2Kgs
9:15
׳
נ alone], אֶתלְֿבָבְךָ

2Kgs 10:15
. compare עם
4.b., which is more frequent in this sense.

4.
מֵאֵת (מֵאִתִּי, etc.; also -מֵאוֺת) from
proximity
with (like Greek παρά with a genitive, From de chez; in
Syriac,
Arabic
[placeholder471: Placeholders/471.gif],
[placeholder472: Placeholders/472.gif] corresponding synonym מֵעִם; see below): coupled almost always with

persons (contrast מֵעִם, a). Thus

a.
with
קָנָה to buy Gen 25:10 + often (compare Gen 17:27); לָקַח
Gen 42:24
; Exod 25:2
; Lev
25:36;
Num
17:17 +
often; נָשָׂא
Ps 24:5
שִׁלַּח, as
Gen 8:8
וַיְשַׁלַּח אֶתהַֿיּוֺנָה מֵאִתּוֺ and he sent forth the dove from with him

Gen 26:27

הָלַךְ
Gen 26:31
;
1Kgs 18:12;
1Kgs 20:36
;
Jer 9:1, of a
wife
deserting her husband
Judg 19:2
וַתֵּלֶךְ מֵאִתּוֺ, Jer 3:1 (compare Isa 57:8); with simile words Gen 38:1; Deut 2:8; 1Kgs 11:23; Jer 2:37
(see Exod 5:20
); Isa
54:10;
Ps
66:20 with שָׁאַל
Judg 1:14;
1Kgs 2:16
; Ps 27:4
+,
דָּרַשׁ
1Kgs 22:7
and
elsewhere, שָׁמַע
1Sam 2:23.
—
׳
מֵאֵת פְּנֵי פּ
Gen 27:30
; Gen
43:34;
Exod
10:11; Job 2:7
; Lev 10:4
(

הַקֹּדֶשׁ), 2Kgs 16:14 (הַבַּיִת). Hence

b. of
rights or
dues, handed over from, given on the part of, any one: Gen 47:22
חֹק מֵאֵת פַּרְעֹה; often in
P
, as
Gen
23:20;
Exod
27:21 a perpetual due מֵאֵת בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל
from, or on the part of, the children of Israel, Lev 7:34 b
Lev 24:8;
Num 3:9; Num 7:84 +;
Deut 18:3;
1Sam 2:13 (

ᵐ5

, etc.; see 1.d.) 2Sam 15:3
וְשֹׁמֵעַ אֵיןלְֿךָ מֵאֵת הַמֶּלֶךְ but there is none to hear thee
deputed of
the king, 1Kgs 5:14.

c. expressing origination: 1Kgs
1:27
אִם מֵאֵת אֲדֹנִי
הַמֶּלֶךְ נִהְיָה. Especially ׳
מֵאֵת י — of a concrete object proceeding from him: Gen
19:24
(brimstone),
Num 11:31 (a wind), Num 16:35 (fire), 1Sam 16:14 (evil spirit), Isa 38:7
(a sign), Jer 51:53
(wasters),
Mic 5:6 (dew); of wrath Zech 7:12 (compare Num 17:11), teaching Isa 51:4
, the word of prophecy
Jer 7:1
(so
Jer 11:1
;
Jer 18:1
+
often in Jeremiah) Jer 37:17; Ezek 33:30 with 'have I (we) heard' Isa
21:10; Isa 28:22
;
Jer
49:14 (=

Obad 1:1
); of
an event, or phase of history Josh 11:20
הָֽיְתָה
׳
מֵאֵת י
it came of
׳
י to…, 1Kgs 12:24; Hab 2:13; Ps 118:23
הָֽיְתָה זאֹת
׳
מֵאֵת י (

ᵐ5

παρὰ Κυρίου) Ezra 9:8; Neh 6:16 of trouble (רָעָה) 2Kgs
6:33;
Mic 1:12 (
יָרַד); of a good or evil lot, having its source in ׳
י
Jer
13:25
;
Isa
54:17; Ps 109:20, compare Job 2:10; Ps 22:26
מֵאִתְּךָ תְהִלָּתִי
from thee cometh my praise (thou art the source of it); Isa 44:24

Qr

מֵאִתִּי
of myself (compare ἀπ’ ἐμαυτοῦ
John
5:30

Kt
is מִי אִתִּי who was with me ?),

John 54:15

אֶפֶס מֵאוֺתִי not at my instance (compare לֹא
מִנִּי

John
30:1
, לֹא מִמֶּנִּי
Hos 8:4
).

d. of a place 1Kgs 6:33 (corrupt: read with

ᵐ5

ᵑ6

ᵑ9

[partly] מְזוּזֹת רְבֻעוֺת, & compare Ezek 41:21).

Note. אֵת expresses closer association than עִם: hence while

מֵעִם sometimes denotes hardly more than from the surroundings or

belongings of, מֵאֵת expresses from close proximity to
. Thus
Saul asks, מִי הָלַךְ מֵעִמָּנוּ who has gone from (those)
about
us ? but Jacob, speaking of the loss of Joseph, says, Gen 44:28
וַיֵּצֵא הָאֶחָד מֵאִתִּי and the one is gone from with me.
מֵאֵת
is accordingly preferred to מֵעִם in the sense of origination or authorship;
מאת
is not usual in the sense of מֵעִם
c, nor מֵעִם in the sense of מֵאֵת
b..
