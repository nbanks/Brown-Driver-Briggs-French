particular dignity Deut 17:12; Deut 26:3; Deut 26:4. The כהנים of the other cities of Judah,
הבמות
׳
כ, who were not allowed to minister in Jerusalem 2Kgs 23:8 (twice in verse); 2Kgs 23:9; 2Kgs 23:20
, may be an attempt to enforce an exclusion from the priesthood of all but Levitical priests.

6.
Zadokite priests: Ezekiel distinguishes among הכהנים הלוים those of the seed of
Zadok, בְּנֵי צָדוֺק; all but the latter excluded by him from priesthood Ezek 40:46; Ezek 43:19
; Ezek 44:15
; Ezek
48:11 the priests of his code being all Zadokites Ezek 40:45; Ezek 40:46; Ezek 42:13; Ezek 42:14; Ezek 43:24

7.
Aaronic priests. In H. it is taken for granted that a priest is of the seed of Aaron; the plural
is never used; כֹּהֵן is used for any priest Lev 21:9; Lev 22:10; Lev 22:11; Lev 22:12; Lev 22:13
הַכֹּהֵן for Aaron Lev 21:21, and for the official priest (acting for the priesthood, almost
collective) Lev 17:5

הַכֹּהֵן is used of Jehoiada in time of David 1Chr 27:5, and Azariah in the reign of Uzziah

8.
the high priest:
הַכֹּהֵן is frequently used (see 4) to designate the priest who was at
the head of priestly affairs. The adjective הַגָּדוֺל first appears of Jehoiada
2Kgs 12:11
, then of Hilkiah 2Kgs 22:4; 2Kgs 22:8; 2Kgs 23:4; 2Kgs 2:9 after the exile, of Joshua Hag 1:1; Hag 1:12; Hag 1:14; Hag 2:2; Hag 2:4; Zech 3:1; Zech 3:8; Zech 6:11, and Eliashib Neh 3:1; Neh 3:20; Neh 13:28.
But
P
uses it of Aaron and his eldest descendants who are anointed with holy oil Lev 21:10 (
H
; הַגָּדוֺל מֵאֶחָיו
׳
הכ), Num 35:25; Num 35:28 (twice in verse); Josh 20:6, and so הַמָּשִׁיחַ
׳
הַכּ
Lev 4:3; Lev 4:5; Lev 4:16; Lev 6:15, compare
Lev 16:32.
הָראֹשׁ

כ is used of Seraiah 2Kgs 25:18 = Jer 52:24 and, in Chronicler, of Amariah 2Chr 19:11, Jehoiada 2Chr 24:11
, Azariah 2Chr
26:20; 2Chr 31:10 of Aaron, Ezra 7:5. (We also supposes
הרואה in 2Sam 15:27 to be a corruption of הראשׁ, which he regards as
post-exilic insertion. The test is corrupt [see Dr^Sm. 1.c^.];
but this correction is improbable. Lists of high priests occur 1Chr 5:30-41; 1Chr 6:35-38.) A priest of second
rank ((ה)מִשְׁנֶה כֹּהֵן) appears in 2Kgs 23:4 (construct plural incorrect), 2Kgs 25:18
