compare Judg 8:31
. גַּם followed by pronoun also begins a sentence with emphasis in an elevated style,
thou (they) also, Isa 14:10; Jer 12:6 (twice in verse); Jer 48:7; Ezek 16:52; Nah 3:11 (twice in verse).
After a pronoun in an oblique case (Ges^«GKC:135»§ 135^, 2)
Gen 27:34;
1Sam 19:23;
2Sam 17:5;
Jer 25:14;

Exod 2:19; Exod 3:9; Exod 4:14; Josh 7:11 (5 t.)

elsewhere — גַּם ֗֗֗ גַּם (like et … et) both … and

Gen 44:16;
Gen 47:3; Gen 47:19;

Gen 24:44;
Gen 1:26; Gen 12:14;
Gen 26:25:
with negative 1Sam
21:9. —
N.B. In poetry independence and emphasis is sometimes given by גַּם
to a new idea, where in English we should be satisfied with and:
Ps 107:5; Ps 137:1; Job 24:19; Song 7:14; Lam 4:15.

2. with stress on a particular word, even, Exod 4:9; Num 22:33

26:12; Jer
6:11; Jer 12:6
; Jer 14:5;

1Sam 19:24;
1Kgs 17:20;

Hup^Qu. Job vi.^
גַּם רָאֹה: compare below) Ps 118:11; Job 2:10
גַּם אֶתהַֿטּוֺב נְקַבֵּל shall we receive good (emphatic) from God and not
evil ? Job 21:7
interposed once between a substantive and adjective Gen 20:4 gentemne etiam justam interficies?
emphasizing כֹּל, Deut 28:61; Judg 9:49b 1Sam 22:7
גַּםֿ
לְכֻלְּכֶם to all (emphatic) of you will he give …? 2Sam 19:31
גַּם אֶתהַֿכֹּל יִקָּ֑ח
yea, the whole let him take! Isa 26:12
אֶחָד
2Sam 17:12b
and we will not leave גַּם אֶחָד ֗֗֗
even one (similarly 2Sam 17:13 b), Ps 14:3 (= Ps 53:4) אֵין גַּם אֶחָד; an infinitive or cognate accusative
attached to a verb,
Gen 31:15; Gen
46:4; Num
11:15; Num
16:13; 1Sam 1:6
. גַּם שְׁנֵיהֶם literally even both i.e. the one as well as the other
(German alle beide) is said idiomatically, Gen 27:45 (שְׁנֵיכֶם), Deut 22:22; Deut 23:19; 1Sam 25:43 (שְׁתֵּיהֶן
), Prov
17:15;
Prov 20:10; Prov 20:12; Ruth 1:5.

3. introducing a climax, yea, especially in a rhetorical style, Gen 27:33; Deut 23:3; Deut 23:4; Judg 5:4 (twice in
verse); Isa 13:3;
Isa 14:8; Isa 43:13
yea, from to-day I am the same, Isa 44:12
גַּם רָעֵב
yea, he is hungry, and has no strength, Isa 47:3; Isa 48:8 (3 t. in verse); Isa 57:7; Jer 46:16; Jer 48:2; Jer 51:44; Hos 7:9; Ps 41:10; Ps 84:7; Ps 139:12; Isa 66:8

aggravated, case, yea, even, Isa 49:15
yea, these may forgot, Jer 8:17
yea, the stork knoweth, etc., Isa 23:12
גַּם שָׁם
even there no rest shall be for thee (so Ps 139:10), Isa 49:25; Isa 57:6; Jer 23:11b; Mal 3:15; Ps 84:4.

4. expressing correspondence, especially in the matter of
retribution (the גַּם
correlativum), so frequently גַּם אֲנִי, גַּם אָנֹכִי I
also (on my part): — Gen 20:6 I also [as well as thyself] know that thou hast done
this innocently, Josh
24:18; Judg
2:21; 1Sam 1:28
(compare Dr) 1Sam 28:22
גַּם אַתָּה thou also (as I have done 1Sam 28:21), 2Sam 12:13
׳
י
also [responding to thy confession] hath removed thy sin, 2Kgs 2:3; 2Kgs 2:5; Isa 31:2; Isa 66:3-4 (גם ֗֗֗ גם,
emphasizing the action of both parties), Jer 2:36; Jer 4:12 now will I also [in correspondence with their
deeds] speak judgments with them, Jer 7:11; Jer 51:49 (גם ֗֗֗ גם), Ezek 5:8; Ezek 5:11; Ezek 16:43 (וְגַם = therefore
also), Ezek 23:35; Hos 4:6 because thou hast forgotten the direction of thy God, I also
(on my part) will forget thy children, Ps 52:7 (thou lovest evil, etc.) גַּם
אֵל יִתָּצְךָ God also (on his part) will pluck thee up, Ps 71:22; Ps 133:1; Prov 1:26; Job 7:11; Job 12:3; Job 16:4 so וְגַם
Judg 2:3; Amos 4:6; Amos 4:7; Mic 6:13; Mal 2:9. In the
apodosis (uncommon):
Gen 13:16 if a man could number the dust of the earth, גַּם זַרְעֲךָ יִמָּנֶה thy seed
also should be numbered, Jer 31:36; Jer 31:37; Jer 33:21; Jer 33:26; Zech 8:6. The correspondence is sometimes of the nature of a climax: Gen 27:33; Gen 30:8 I have
wrestled, גַּם יָכֹלְתִּי (compare 1Kgs 22:22
וְגַם תּוּכָ֔ל, Jer 50:24), Isa 66:8.

5. connecting two ideas which express (or imply) a contradiction, גַּם acquires
sometimes an adversative force (compare אַף
1 end), yet, but, though:
Ps 95:9 they tried
me, but also (Che) saw my work (namely of judgment),
Ps 129:2; Jer 6:15 = Jer 8:12; Ezek 20:23;
Eccl 4:8; Eccl 4:16; Eccl 5:18; Neh 6:1. So
וְגַם
Ezek 16:28;
Ezek 20:15;
Eccl 3:13; Eccl 6:7; Neh 5:8.

6.
גַּם כִּי (with imperfect) yea, when
Lam 3:8,
even when
Prov 22:6
yea though (stating an imagined case) Isa 1:15; Hos 8:10; Hos 9:16; Ps 23:4 (so גַּם אִם
Eccl 8:17);
also (is it) that
Ruth 2:21 (see

כִּי
1.d.). כִּי גַם = for even (see above 2
); = though even, although (conceding a fact) Eccl 4:14 (see De) Eccl 8:12.
