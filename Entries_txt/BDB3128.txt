1. thing hostile to theocracy, and therefore (in the strictest application) to be either destroyed,
or, in the case of certain objects (e.g. silver and gold, vessels of brass and iron Josh 6:19; Josh 6:24), set apart to sacred uses;
especially

a. of a Canaan. city, as Jericho, including all inhabitants (except Rahab's family)
and spoil Josh 6:17

(compare 1Sam 15:3

1Sam 15:8 Saul

ח, with all its contents, and be utterly destroyed Deut 13:17 (compare v.Deut 13:13 v.Deut 13:15
v.Deut 13:16

2. apparently (so Di) anything devoted

to sanctuary under specially stringent conditions Lev 27:28 (see Di; and
