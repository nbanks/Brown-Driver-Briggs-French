Biblical Hebrew

אפת (meaning dubious √ whence Arabic
[placeholder378: Placeholders/378.gif]
calamity, & also wonder, portent; according to Thes Arabic √ =
[placeholder379: Placeholders/379.gif]
suffer evil).
but Thes^612. Add. 72^ deletes אפת, and derives מוֺפֵת
from √ פו׳׳, so Ba^NB § 172 c^; see also, on
[placeholder380: Placeholders/380.gif] as late by-form of
[placeholder381: Placeholders/381.gif], DBMacdonald^JBL xiv (1895). 58 ff.^.
