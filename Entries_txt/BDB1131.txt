י,
Num 32:12;
Josh 11:19: so בִּלְתִּי אִם

3.
conjunction (likewise after a negative, expressed or implied) Gen 43:3
בִּלְתִּי אֲחִיכֶם אִתְּכֶם
except your brother (be) with you, Gen 43:5; Num 11:6 our soul is dry, there is nothing at all;
save that our eyes are toward the manna, Isa 10:4 (and where will ye leave your glory ?) save that
they bow down under the prisoners, and fall under the slain! i.e. (iron.) their only refuge will be
among the corpses of a battle-field. So בִּלְתִּי אִם
Amos 3:3; Amos 3:4. — Dan 11:18,
where no negative precedes, it is difficult to extract a sense consistent with the general usage of
בִּלְתִּי: Ges
besides that his reproach he will return unto him, Ew
only, nothing but, Hi
certainly, Drechsler (on Isa 10:4) nay, even (compare
RV
).
