Theod
Sym, and so Jerome, think of Aramaic victorious
, but no clear explanation;

εἰς τὸ τέλος (probably לַמִּנְצָח) follows ordinary meaning of noun נֵצַח
, which may be explained in eschatological sense as referring to end of age of world after Euseb

Theod
; or for full rendering after De;
neither
satisfactory. Chronicles, near in date, gives the clue which is intrinsically probably: לְ
indicates, not assignment (nothing special in these Psalms to suggest it, and assignment of Psalms for such use
a
matter of course), but that these Psalms were taken by final editor from an older major Psalter known as the
Director's Collection, compare the still earlier collections known as (ל)דוד, (ל)אסף
, (ל)בני קרח. The 55 Psalms with למנצח were taken 39 from Davidic, 9
from
Korahite, and 5 from Asaphic Psalters; only 2 anonymous. Hab 3 originally belonged to Director's Psalter. This and other
Director's Psalms have musical directions in titles. The Director's Psalter was probably the prayer-book of
synagogue of Greek period, presupposed by our Hab., the collection of the twelve Minor Prophets, the prophetic
canon, and Daniel (see Br^Gen. Intr. 123^).
