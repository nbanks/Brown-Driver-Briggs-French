Biblical Hebrew

אַרְיוֺךְ
proper name, masculine
king of Ellasar
Gen 14:1; Gen 14:9, ally of
Chedorlaomer in his western foray (probably = Rim-Aku, Elamite king of Larsa = Ellasar;
compare COT^ ii. 297 f.^).
On Rim-Akw (= Eri-Aku ?), see now also Dr^Comm.
Gn. 156 ff.^; Zim^KAT 3. 367^ thinks identification very dubious.
