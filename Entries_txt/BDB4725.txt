Biblical Hebrew

מנן (of following; Arabic
[placeholder3040: Placeholders/3040.gif] is praecidit funem, diminuit numerum,
debilitavit; also be bounteous, Qor 3:158 and elsewhere,
[placeholder3041: Placeholders/3041.gif]
a gift; whence Zerweck^Präp. Min 4^
assumes a primary meaning to separate — either from
or for ("zutheilen"), as the case might be).
