Dl^W^ (but between verbs the usually connective is the enclitic
ma
KAT^2. 508^, Dl^§§ 82,
150^). The use in Hebrew shews that original וְ was not a merely copulative
conjunction, but that it possessed a demonstrative force (compare Dr^§ 122^), which is often perceptible as such, though in other cases,
from its being applied to denote mere juxtaposition or connection [compare Greek τε, and Latin
tum …. tum = 'both …. and,' both properly demonstratives: Assyrian

ma
has also a demonstrative force, Dl^§ 79^], it is
less palpable) — וְ before shwa' mobile or a labial is vocalized וּ; often before
a tone-syll., when the word itself has a disj. accent, וָ (as וַָמתִּי׃

וְ is used very freely and widely in Hebrew, but also with much delicacy, to express relations and
shades of meaning which Western languages would usually indicate by distinct particles. But in Hebrew particles such
as אוֺ, אָז, אַךְ, אָכֵן, אוּלָם
, בַּעֲבוּר, לְמַעַן, לָכֵן, etc., were reserved for
cases in which special emphasis or distinctness was desired: their frequent use was felt instinctively to be
inconsistent with the lightness and grace of movement which the Hebrew ear loved; and thus in
AV
,
RV
, words like or, then, but, notwithstanding, howbeit, so, thus, therefore, that,
constantly appear, where the Hebrew has simply וְ.

1.
And, connecting both words (see above), and sentences (Gen 1:5
׳
וְלַחשֶׁךְ קָרָא וג). When three, four, or more words follow, the conjunction may connect them
all, as Gen 7:21
; Gen 10:2 (6
t.) Gen 24:35
(7 t.) Josh
7:24 (10 t.) 2Sam 17:28f.: often however it is prefixed only to the last, as Gen 5:32; Gen 10:1; Deut 18:10
etc.; occas. even it connects only the first two, 1Kgs 8:47; Isa 1:13; Ps 45:9; Job 42:9. Remarkably, however, וְ as a
mere conjunction is, as a rule, not in classical Hebrew attached directly to verbs
(especially in the perfect), the construction with וְ consecutive (see 2
) being (as in Moabite) preferred: thus יָצָא וַיִּבֶן is said, not יָצָא
וּבָנָה. Exceptions in classical Hebrew are (a) sometimes where
synonyms are coupled, as Num 23:19
אָמַר ֗֗֗ וְדִבֶּר, Deut 2:30; Judg 5:26; 1Sam 12:2; Isa 1:2
גדּלתי ורוממתי
Isa 2:11; Isa 5:14; Isa 8:8; Isa 19:6; Isa 29:20 (
b) isolated cases, difficult to reduce to rule (perhaps sometimes due to textual error), as
Gen 28:6; Gen 38:5; Judg 3:23; Judg 7:13; Judg 16:18;
1Sam 1:12; 1Sam 3:13; 1Sam 4:19; 1Sam 5:7; 1Sam 10:9; 1Sam 17:38;
1Sam 17:48;
1Sam 25:20
and elsewhere (in other passages, apparently similar, the perfect and וְ has a frequent. force
(see 2), as Gen 37:3; Exod 36:29f.; Num 10:17f. Num 21:15; Num 21:20; 1Sam 2:22; 1Sam 16:14; 1Sam 17:34f.
(see Dr) 1Sam 27:9; 2Sam 16:13; 2Sam 17:17, perhaps also Gen 15:6; Gen 21:25; Gen 34:5). In
later parts of OT, probably through Aramaic influence, the perfect with simple וְ occurs more
frequently: so especially in Ecclesiastes, where it is all but universal (e.g. Gen 2:11; Gen 2:12; Gen 2:13; Gen 2:15 etc.). With the imperfect,
the simple וְ is not so unidiomatic, even in classical Hebrew (compare 3); see

Ges^«GKC:112»§ 112^. 6. Special senses: —

a.
it sometimes = and specially, Gen 3:16; 1Kgs 11:1 many strange women, and
specially the daughter of Pharaoh, Isa 1:1 Judah and (= and particularly
) Jerusalem, Isa 2:1; Isa 9:7; Ps 18:1.

b.
and in particular ('und zwar'), and that (explicative), Gen 4:4; Judg 7:22;
1Sam 17:40

וּבַיַּלְקוּט, 1Sam 28:3 in Ramah, and that in his city (unusual:
text suspicious), 2Sam 13:20
וְשֹׁמֵמָה
and that desolate, Isa 57:11 I have been silent וּמֵעוֺלָם
and that from of old, Isa 32:7; Jer 15:13; Amos 3:11 (si vera lectio), Amos 4:10;

1Chr 9:27; 2Chr 8:13;
2Chr 29:27
(but' even' for ו, before ל and infinitive, e.g. in Isa 44:28
; Jer
17:10; Jer 19:12, is wrong; see Ew^§ 351
c^, Dr^§ 206^).

c.
sometimes it introduces an idea which so exceeds or adds to what has preceded, that it is nearly
equivalent to also, 1Sam 25:43; 1Kgs 2:22 ask also the kingdom
for him; unusually
Hos 8:6
כי מישׂראל והוא for of Israel is it also, Eccl 5:6
והבלים (see De) 2Chr 27:5 (but see

ᵐ5

). Or it may be rendered yea: so especially in the ascending numerations 3-4
Amos 1:3;
Amos 1:6;
Amos 1:9;
Amos 1:11
; Amos 1:13
; Amos 2:1
; Amos 2:4
; Amos 2:6
;
Prov 30:18; Prov 30:21; Prov 30:29; Prov 30:6-7; Prov 6:16; Job 5:19; Job 5:7-8; Mic 5:4 — the first number
being aggravated, or augmented, by a higher. In one idiom וּגְבוּל, occurring in geographic
descriptions, it is used peculiarly, seemingly = at the same time:
Num 34:6 and
as for the western border, וְהָיָה לָכֶם הַיָּם הַגָּדוֺל וּגְבוּל the great sea shall be
to you also (German 'zugleich') a border, Deut 3:16
תּוֺךְ הַנַּחַל וּגְבוּל the middle of the stream being at the same time
the border, Deut 3:17; Josh 13:23; Josh 13:27; Josh 15:12; Josh 15:47 (but these, except
Num 34:6,
might be cases of 5.c.
γ).

d. it connects alternative cases, so that
it = or:
Exod
20:10;
Exod 20:17; Exod 21:16 he that stealeth a man
וּמְכָרוֺ וְנִמְצָא בְיָדוֺ and selleth him, and (=
or if) he be found in his hand, Exod 21:17; Lev 21:14; Lev
22:23;
Lev 22:24; Prov 29:9 (Fl

Ew

RV
: whether . . . or) Job 31:13; Job 31:16; Job
31:26, etc.

e. it connects contrasted ideas,
where in our idiom the contrast would be expressed explicitly by but; in such
cases prominence is usually given to the contrasted idea by its being placed immediately after the
conjunction: Gen 2:17

but of the tree of the knowledge . . . thou shalt not eat, Gen 4:2; Gen 4:5;
Gen 6:8;
Gen
17:21;
Gen 31:10 etc., 1Kgs 2:26; 1Kgs 10:7; 1Kgs
11:32; 1Kgs 11:34; 1Kgs 15:14; Prov 10:1; Prov
10:2;
Prov 10:3; Prov 10:4 + often; even after לֹא
(where כִּי or כִּי אִם might be expected), as Gen
42:10;
Exod 21:18; Lev 26:45; Deut 11:11; Judg
19:12;
1Kgs 3:11.

f. it introduces a contrasted idea in
such a way as to suggest a question, especially before a pronoun, Judg
14:16 I told it not to my father or my mother, וְלָךְ אַגִּיד and shall I
told it unto thee?

2Sam 11:11; Jer 25:29
וְאַתֶּם הִנָּקֵה תִנָּקוּ and shall ye be guiltless? Jer 45:5
; Ezek
20:31; Ezek 33:25b Jonah 4:11. So the
וְ consecutive and perfect (see 2.a.),
Exod 5:5
וְהִשְׁבַּתֶּם
and will ye make them rest from their burdens? Num 16:10
וּבִקַּשְׁתֶּם
and seek ye the priesthood also? 1Sam 25:11;

Isa 66:9; Ps 50:21
and shall I keep silence? Job 32:16 (compare Dr^§ 119^

γ).

g. attaching a fresh subj. (or object) to a clause
already grammatically complete, it = and also, Gen 2:9b Num
16:2;
Num 16:18 and they stood at the entrance of the tent of
meeting, ומשׁה ואהרן
and Moses and Aaron (stood also), Num 16:27; Exod 35:22; Judg 6:5; Gen 1:16 b Gen 12:17; Gen 44:2; Gen 46:15;
Exod 29:3; Jer 32:29 (compare
Dr^Sm. i. 6, 11, & p. 293^): when the idea thus attached is
subordinate, or not logically embraced in the principal predicate, it approximates to the
Arabic
[placeholder1345: Placeholders/1345.gif] or 'waw of association' (followed by an accusative:

W^AG ii. § 37^), Esth 4:16
אֲנִי וְנַעֲרֹתַי אָצוּם I will fast (singular) and
(= with) my maidens,
Exod 21:4; 1Sam 25:42; 1Sam 29:10b (but insert here אַתָּה with

וְ repeated = both . . . and (but גַּם ֗֗֗
גַּם) is more usual in this sense); Gen 34:28; Num

9:23; 2Sam
5:8 (text dubious),
Isa 16:5; Isa 38:15; Jer 13:14;

Jer 40:8;
Ps 76:7; Job 34:29;
Dan 8:13; Neh 12:28.

i. a repetition of the
same word with וְ interposed expresses (a
) diversity (rare), Deut 25:13
אֶבֶן וָאֶבֶן a weight and a weight, i.e. different
weights (explained by גְּדֹלָה וּקְטַנָּה), Deut 25:14;
Prov 20:23
; Ps 12:3
בְּלֵב וָלֵב with a heart and a heart = with a double heart, 1Chr 12:33
בְּלֹא לֵב וָלֵב; (b) distribution
(except in דֹּר וָדֹר

Deut 32:7; Isa 13:20 + often exclusively a late usage: compare
Dr^Intr. 505^) Ps 87:5; 1Chr 26:13
לְשַׁעַר וָשָֽׁעַר׃ = for every gate, 1Chr 28:14 (twice in verse); 2Chr 8:14;

35:15; Ezra 10:14
זִקְנֵי עִיר וָעִיר elders of every city, Neh 13:24; Esth 1:8; Esth 1:22

Esth 9:27;

Esth 9:28; Ps 45:18; Ps 145:13 (common in
post-Biblical Hebrew, especially with כל).

j. it is
used in the formulation of proverbs (the Vav adaequationis,
וָו הִשְׁתַּוָּאָה) as Prov 17:3; Prov 25:3; Prov 25:20; Prov 25:25 cold waters to
a thirsty soul and good news from a far country (i.e. they are like
each other), Prov
26:3;
Prov 26:9; Prov 26:14; Prov 26:20; Prov 27:21; Eccl 5:2; Eccl 7:1;

Eccl 8:8 compare Eccl 9:11; Ps 19:5; Ps 125:2

14:11f.; Job 14:19 (compare in
Arabic 'every man and his cares [accusative],'
'every thing and its price,' i.e. they go together: 'merchants
and dogs [accusative] of Seleucia,' i.e. they
are like one another: see Fl^Kl. Schr. iii. 535 f.^

k. in circumstantial clauses וְ
introduces a statement of the concomitant conditions under which the
action denoted by the principal verb takes place: in such cases, the relation expressed by
וְ must often in English be stated explicitly by a conjunction, as
when, since, seeing, though, etc., as occasion may require. So very
often, as Gen 11:4
let us build a tower וְראֹשׁוֺ בַשָּׁמַיִם

and its top in the heavens (= with its top in
etc.), Gen 18:12
shall I have pleasure, וַאדֹנִי זָקֵן

and my lord is old (= my lord being old)? Judg 16:15 How sayest thou, I
love thee, וְלִבְּךָ
אֵין אִתִּי
and (= when) thy heart is not with me? and
especially with a person pronoun, Gen 15:2 what wilt thou give me וְאָנֹכִי

הֹלֵךְ עֲרִירִי
and I (= the case being that I) am going hence
childless? Gen
18:13; Gen
20:3 lo, thou wilt die because of the
woman thou hast taken וְהִוא בְּעֻלַת בָּֽעַל׃ = seeing
she is married, Gen 24:62
וְהוּא ישֵׁב = since or for
he was dwelling (different from וַיֵּשֶׁב = and he proceeded
to dwell), Gen 26:27
וְאַתֶּם
seeing ye hate me, Judg 13:9 and came to her וְהִיא
ישֶׁבֶת = as she was sitting, 1Sam 18:23
; 1Kgs
19:19 + often of a more exceptional type are Ps 72:12 the afflicted וְאֵיןעֹֿזֵר
לוֺ
and (= when) he has no helper (compare Job 29:12),

Job 104:25

Job 105:34

See more fully Dr^§ 156-60^

use of the
[placeholder1346: Placeholders/1346.gif] is very common in Arabic: W^ii. §
183^.) Introducing an appeal to a fact confirmatory
of some statement or promise, it almost = as truly as
(compare Ew^§ 340 c^) Hos 12:6
and J. is God of hosts, J. is his name! Joel 4:20;
Amos 9:5-6; Isa 51:15
and I [who promise this] am J. thy God, who . . . . ! Jer 29:23; Ps 89:38b (compare in
Qoran the frequently 'And God is . . . . [the mighty, the merciful, etc.]').

2. The ו consecutive (formerly called the Waw 'conversive'); —

a.
with the imperfect (וַּ with following daghesh; before א

, וָ), as וַיּאֹמֶר properly = and he proceeded to say,
chiefly in contin. of a preceding Perfect tense (so Moabite);

b. with the

perfect (וְ, — in 1 & 2 singular, the tone, with certain exceptions [see Dr^§ 110^], being thrown forward to the ultima), as
וְיָָֽשַׁבְתָּ֫ properly so [namely, as limited by a verb, or other term,
preceding] hadst thou sat, chiefly in continuation of a preceding Imperfect
tense, in its various senses of future, jussive, or frequentative. Thefurther analysis of these idioms belongs

the grammar; see on a.
Dr^Ch. vi.^, Ges
^«GKC:111»§ 111^, and on b.
Dr^Ch. viii.^
Ges^«GKC:112»§ 112^. Here it must suffice to note — (
a) ו consecutive (especially with the imperfect) frequently couples two

verbs
in such a manner that the first, indicating the general character of the
action,
receives its closer definition in the second: in such cases, the first may often be represented in English by an
adverb, as Gen 26:18
וַיָּשָׁב וַיַּחְפֹּר and he turned and dug = and he dug
again
; so often; and similarly with הוֺסִיף
Gen 25:1,

מִהַר

Josh 7:7, etc.;
more
exceptionally, Gen

. In Arabic the stronger form of the conjugation
[placeholder1347: Placeholders/1347.gif] here corresponds: W^ii. § 140^). (
b) וַּ  with the imperfect sometimes expresses a contrast = and yet

(compare Dr^§
74^
β). (c) there is a tendency in the later books of the OT to use the perfect with
simple וְ, where the classical language would employ the imperfect with וַּ
(compare above 1); so especially in Ecclesiastes, where וַּ  occurs thrice only,
Job 1:17; Job 4:1; Job 4:7. (
d
) a double perfect with ו consecutive is sometimes used, informally but neatly, with
a
hypothetical force; thus (α) in past or present time Exod 16:21
וְחַם הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ וְנָמָֽס׃ and the sun used to be warm, and it used to melt = and if

וְֹשָׁב וְנִחַמְתִּ֫י = and if it turns, I repent, Jer 20:9 (see
