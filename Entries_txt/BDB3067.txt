this participle agrees with noun in sense, and is masculine; and the clarions
(= players on the clarions) sounded. — The חֲצֹצְרָה, or
(sacred) clarion, was a long, straight, slender metal tube, with flaring end, see
Benz^Archäol. 277^; distinguished thus from the שׁוֺפָר which was
originally
a ram's horn, and probably always retained the horn-shape; the שׁוֺפָר is mentioned constantly
in
the earlier literature, and was used by watchmen, warriors, etc., as well as priests (see Benz^ib. 276 and^
שׁוֺפָר).
