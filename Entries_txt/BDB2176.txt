Biblical Hebrew

[מַהֲלָל] noun [masculine]
praise; — only in וְאִישׂ
לְפִי מַהֲלָלוֺ
Prov 27:21
the refining pot silver, and the furnace for gold, and a man according to his praise, i.e.
probably according to the praise of him by others, which tests him; so De
Str and others; perhaps however so let a man be to the mouth of
his praise, i.e. that praise him, — testing the praise to determine its
worth, Thes
Rob-Ges; other views are: according to the measure of his
boasting
Ew, i.e. is judged according to his success or failure in that of which he
boasts; Hi
according to the thing of which he boasts.
