Biblical Hebrew

I. בֹּר
noun masculine
lye, potash, alkali used in smelting metals Isa 1:25
read probably כַּכֻּר
as in a furnace (Isa 48:10); there seems no evidence that 'lye' (i.e. water mixed with the burnt
ashes of plants containing potash, used formerly for washing) was ever used in refining gold or silver: compare J.
Napier^Anc. Workers in Metal {1856}, 15, 20, 25^ WAM in Smith^DB ii. 368; Amer. Rev. Ed. (1871, vol,
iii), 1939^. (see
