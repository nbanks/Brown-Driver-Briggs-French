c. it is used in questions which, by seeming to make doubtful what cannot be
denied,
have the force of an impassioned or indignant affirmation: Gen 27:36 ('dubitantis speciem prae se fert Esavus, ut eo
acerbius affirmet,' Maurer, cited by Ges), 1Sam 2:27
הֲנִגְלהֹ נִגְלֵיתִי וגי

הֲרָאִיתָ
dost thou see ?
1Kgs 20:13
;

elsewhere

d. in disjunctive questions, the first question being introduced usually by

הֲ, the second by אִם or (more rarely) וְאִם: see examples under
אִם
2 (p. 50). The disjunctive question may express a real alternative (as Josh 5:13), or (as especially in
poetry)
the same thought may be repeated in a different form, in two parallel clauses (e.g. Isa 10:15): in the latter case,
the
answer No is usually expected. Only very rarely is the second question introduced by

הֲ
Judg 14:15
(where, however, הֲלֹם ought no doubt to be read, with
MSS
.,

ᵑ7

Be and others, for הֲלֹא), or אוֺ

Job 16:3; Job 38:28;
Job 38:31.
