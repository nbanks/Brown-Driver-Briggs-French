Biblical Hebrew

גבל (according to Thes originally twist, wind
, whence not only גַּבְלֻת, מִגְבָּלֹת, but also גְּבוּל
(cord and then) boundary, as determined by measuring cord,
or line, whence verb denominative גָּבַל
bound, border, q. v. below; Late Hebrew גָּבַל, Aramaic גְּבַל
mean mix, knead; Arabic
[placeholder778: Placeholders/778.gif], Syriac
[placeholder779: Placeholders/779.gif] = create, fashion; MV assume
meaning massive, whence Arabic
[placeholder780: Placeholders/780.gif]
mountain (compare Assyrian
gablu
HA^48^), and גְּבוּל as originally earth-wall, etc., serving as
boundary; this explains גַּבְלֻת etc. less well).
