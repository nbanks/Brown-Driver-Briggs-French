Biblical Hebrew

הַל
Deut 32:6
הַל יְהוָֺה תִּגְמְלוּזֹֿאת (so v. d. H and other
editions) The reading here became early a subject of dispute, and
MSS
. and editions vary accordingly. Some follow the school of Nehardea, and read הַל יְהוָֺה;
others (so Norzi) follow the school of Sora, and read הַ לְיהוָֺה
; others (so Hahn) have הַלְיהוָֺה. Were הַל original, it would be an
interrogative particle = Arabic
[placeholder1227: Placeholders/1227.gif], for which elsewhere הֲ is always found. The other punctuations would also each
be highly irregular. The true reading is undoubtedly (הַלְיַהְוֶה) הֲלַיהוָֺה. compare De Rossi^Var. Lect.^
on the passage; and on the possible origin of the anomaly,
Gei^Jüd. Ztschr. 1864-65, p. 89 f^.
