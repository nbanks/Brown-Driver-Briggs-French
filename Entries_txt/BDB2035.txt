1. joined with substantives:

a. to mark a definite concrete object, as Gen 1:1
the heavens and the earth, הַמֶּלֶךְ the king,
etc.
Never, however (as in Greek e.g. ὁ Πλάτων), before true proper names, though it is used with certain
terms, chiefly geographical, of which the original appellative sense has not been lost, as הַבַּעַל

'Baal,' literally 'the lord,' in plural הַבְּעָלִים i.e. the various local Baals,
הַשָּׂטָן

the Adversary Job 1:6ff. (as a proper name שָׂטָן, 'Satan,' only 1Chr 21:1);
הַלְּבָנוֺן (but not הַחֶרְמוֺן), הַיַּרְדֵּן (but not

הָאַרְנֹן), הַכַּרְמֶל, הַשָּׁרוֺן the Sharon,
הַשְּׁפֵלָה
the (Judaean) lowland, הַכִּכָּר, הַמִּישׁוֺר the (Moabite)
table-land,
הָעֲרָבָה, הָעַי '`Ai,' הַגִּבְעָה 'Gibeah,' Judg 20:5ff.,
הַגָּלִיל
'Galilee,' הַגִּלְגָּל, הַגִּלְבֹּעַ, הַבָּשָׁן,
הַגִּלְעָד (often), הַשִּׁטִּים, הַמִּצְפָּה, הָרָמָה
, הַיְשִׁימוֺן, הָעֹפֶל, הַפִּסְגָּה.

b.
with an adjective to denote one who exhibits a quality κατ’ ἐξοχήν, i.e. to express the
comparative or superlative degree: so often, as Gen 1:16
המאור הגדל the greater light, המאור
הקטן the lesser light, Gen 27:1
בנו הגדול = his elder son, Gen 48:14
הצעיר the younger, Gen 42:13
הַקָּטֹן the little one, i.e. the youngest, (of Joseph's brethren), Lev 21:10
הַגָּדוֺל מֵאֶחָיו the chiefest of his brethren, Num 35:25 + הכהן
הגדול
the chief priest, ׳
הצעיר ב the least among Judg 6:15, הצעירה מן the
least
of 1Sam
9:21
, ׳
הַיָּפָה ב the fairest among Song 1:8; 2Kgs 10:3; Prov 30:30, compare Job 14:15.

c.
with nouns which are not definite in themselves, but acquire their definition from the context, or
from
the manner in which they are introduced: thus (α) in the standing phrases
הַיּוֺם

to-day, Gen 4:14; Gen 21:26 + often; הַלַּיְלָה
to-night, Gen 19:5; Gen 30:15 +, once 1Sam 15:16
last night; so הַשָּׁנָה
this year, 2Kgs 19:29; Jer 28:16
הַפַּעַם
this time, Gen 18:32 +. (β) הַנָּהָר
the river (κατ’ ἐξοχήν), i.e. the Euphrates; Exod 2:15
the well, the well namely of the district, Josh 8:11
the valley, 1Sam 17:3; 1Sam 19:10
the wall, 1Sam 19:13
the bed, 1Sam 20:21
הַנַּעַר
the lad (whom Jonathan would naturally take with him), 1Sam 20:34
the table. Hence occas. where a suffix would define the noun more precisely, as
הַחֲמוֺר
2Sam 19:27
+
= my ass, Judg 3:20; 1Sam 1:9
הַכִּסֵּא = his seat, Judg 4:15; 1Kgs 22:35; 2Kgs 10:15 + הַמֶּרְכָּבָה
, 1Sam
18:10;
1Sam 20:33
הַחֲנִית.

d. it is a peculiarity of Hebrew thought to conceive an object
as
defined by its being taken for a particular purpose, and thus by a kind of prolepsis to
prefix the article to the noun denoting it: 1Sam 10:1 and Samuel took אֶתפַּֿךְ הַשֶּׁמֶן literally

the cruse of oil, not, however, a cruse which had been defined previously, but one rendered
definiteby being now taken; in English idiom 'a cruse of oil,' v
1Sam 10:25
בַּסֵּפֶר literally in the scroll or book, the one, namely taken for the
purpose, i.e. in a scroll (so Exod 17:14; Num 5:23; Job 19:23), Job 21:10
בַּשִּׂמְלָה, Judg 4:18
וַתְּכַסֵּהוּ בַּשְּׂמִיכָה, Judg 4:19; Judg 7:13
הָאֹהֶל
a tent, Judg 8:25; Judg 9:48
אֶתהַֿקַּרְדֻּמֹּת
hatchets, Judg 20:16 every one able to sling בָּאֶבֶן אֶלהַֿשַּׂעֲרָה
with
a stone at a hair, 1Sam 6:8
בָּאַרְגָּז (unless indeed the אַרְגָּז was an understood appendage in every
cart), Num 11:27

הַנַּעַר, a young man, Num 13:23
בַּמּוֺט on a pole, Josh 2:15
בַּחֶבֶל with a cord, 2Sam 17:17
השׁפחה
a girl (compare Dr^
1Sam 1:4;
1Sam
19:13

^). Sometimes it is uncertain whether an article is to be referred to c.
or
d.: e.g. 1Sam 2:13
his prong or a prong, 2Sam 18:9
his mule or a mule, etc.

e. with nouns that
denote objects or classes of objects that are known to all, as הַצּאֹן,
הַזָּהָב, הַמַּיִם; Gen 13:2 Abram was very rich בַּמִּקְנֶה בַּכֶּסֶף וּבַזָּהָב
, Exod 31:4

לַעֲשׂוֺת בַּזָּהָב וּבַכֶּסֶף, Deut 14:26 and thou shalt lay out the money בַּבָּקָר

וּבַצּאֹן וּבַיַּיִן וּבַשֵּׁכָר, 2Kgs 9:30
וַתָּשֶׂם בַּפּוּךְ עֵינֶיהָ, in French 'elle mit du fard à ses yeux.'
It
is, however, remarkable that this usage depends mostly on the punctuation, הַכֶּסֶף,
הַיַּיִן, הַלֶּחֶם etc. (except as applied to denote definite

quantities of gold, wine, etc., as Josh 6:24) being far less common than כֶּסֶף, יַיִן
etc., but בַּכֶּסֶף, לַכֶּסֶף etc. being much more frequently than
בְּכֶסֶף, לְכֶסֶף etc.: for instances in which the article forms part of the
consonantal text, see
Gen
6:20; Gen 7:8

+ העוף and הבהמה, Deut 8:3
הַלָּחֶם,
1Kgs 5:8;
1Kgs 5:13; Isa
28:7
הַיַּיִן and הַשֵּׁכָר, Isa 60:17; Ezek 15:4; Ezek 15:7
הָאֵשׁ, Hab
2:5; Prov
20:1;
Ps
65:14
הַצּאֹן, Song 1:11; Eccl 7:12. compare below, h.

f. in
comparisons,
the object compared being, as a rule, not an individual as such, but one exhibiting the characteristics of a
class:
Isa 1:18
כַּשָּׁנִים, כַּתּוֺלָע like scarlet, like crimson (both meant generally),
Isa 5:24
כַּמַּק יִהְיֶה, Isa 5:28
כַּצַּר and כַּסּוּפָה, Isa 10:14
כַּקֵּן, Isa 13:8
כַּיּוֺלֵדָה (as always with this word, e.g. Isa 42:14; Ps 48:7), Ps 11:7
כַּבָּקָר; + often (The usage is not, however, quite uniform, at least according to the
punctuation: there occurs e.g. כְּקַשׁ
Job 41:21
;
Isa 47:14

כְּאַרְיֵה
Ps 7:3 and
elsewhere:
and we find both כַּלָּבִיא) Isa 5:29 and כְּלָבִיא
Hos 13:8
כָּאֲרִי
Isa 38:13

and
כַּאֲרִי
Num 24:9
כַּגִּבּוֺר
Isa 42:13

and
כְּגבור
Job 16:14

etc.) Similarly
Gen
19:28
כְּקִיטֹר הַכִּבְשָׁן as the smoke of a furnace, Num 11:8; Num 11:12
כַּאֲשֶׁר יִשָּׂא
הָאֹמֵן אֶתהַֿיֹּנֵק, Deut 28:29 (הָעִוֵּר), Judg 8:18b כְּתֹאַר
בְּנֵי
הַמֶּלֶךְ, Judg 14:6
כְּשַׁסַּע הַגְּדִי like (a lion's) rending a kid, Judg 16:9;
1Kgs 14:15
;
Zech 12:10
כְּ מִסְפֵּד עַל הַיָּחִיד as mourning over an only child, Zech 13:9
+.
Where, however, the standard of comparison is not the class in general, but only a particular part of it,
defined by
a special epithet (whether adjective or verb), the article is naturally omitted: thus כַּמֹּץ

like
chaff (in general)
Isa 41:15, but כְּמֹץ עֹבֵר like chaff passing away Isa 29:5
כַּצֵּל
Job 14:2,
but
כְּצֵל נָטוּי
Ps 102:12

כַּקַּשׁ
Isa 40:24
,
but
כְּקַשׁ נִדָּף
Isa 41:2
כָּאַיָּל
Isa 35:6,
but,
׳
כְּאַיָּל תַּעֲרֹג על וג like a hind (that) longeth for streams of water

Ps 42:2
כָּאֵשׁ
Isa 9:17,
but
כְּאֵשׁ תבער יער like fire (that)
kindleth
a wood
Ps 83:15

כֶעָשָׁן
Isa 51:6,
but
כְּעָשָׁן מֵאֲרֻבָּה like smoke from a chimney
Hos 13:3:
so
Isa 62:1b
Job 9:26;
Job 11:16

כְּמַיִם עָֽבְרוּ like waters (that) have passed by, etc.; Deut 32:2 a

כַּמָּטָר, כַּטַּל, but Deut 32:2 b כִּשְׂעִירִים עֲלֵידֶֿשֶׁא,

כִּרְבִיבִים
עֲלֵיעֵֿשֶׂב. Where the article is found, although a rel. clause follows (as Ps 1:4; Ps 49:13
; Isa 61:10
),
this is probably to be
regarded not as limiting the class of object compared, but as describing
it.

g. prefixed to generic nouns (in the singular)
it
designates the class, i.e. it imparts to the noun a collective
force,
as Exod 1:22

כָּלהַֿבֵּן all (literally the whole of) the sons,
כָּלהַֿבַּת
all the daughters, Lev 17:8; Lev 17:10
מִןהַֿגֵּר of the strangers, who sojourn in their midst, Num 21:7
הַגנָּחָשׁ
the serpents; Gen 14:13; Ezek 24:26; Ezek 33:21
הַפָּלִיט those who escaped; Josh 6:7 + הֶחָלוּץ, v Josh 9:13
הַמְאַסֵּף; Josh 8:19
הָאוֺרֵב; 1Sam 13:17
הַמַּשְׁחִית; Mic 2:13; Isa 6:4
הַקּוֺרֵא the choir of criers; 1Sam 24:14
הַקַּדְמֹנִי the ancients; Eccl 7:26
אֶתהַֿאִשָּׁה woman, and often with gentile names, as הַיְבוּסִי the
Jebusites,
הַכְּרֵתִי וְהַפְּלֵתִי
2Sam 8:18
and
elsewhere, הַדָּנִי
Judg 18:1
etc.,
הַלֵּוִי the Levites,

Mal 2:8; Ps 135:20
+.

h. with nouns denoting abstract ideas, especially the names of moral qualities (compare
Greek
ἡ δίκη, French la justice), chiefly in two cases — (α) where the article is
recognizable
in
the consonantal text, exceptionally, when some emphasis or definiteness is intended, as Deut 7:9
שׁומר הברית והחסד; החסד הזה
2Sam 2:5;
1Kgs 3:6

Eccl 7:19
;
Eccl 10:6

punctuation,
after
prepositions, especially בְּ, but with much irregularity, as בַּחֶסֶד

Prov 2:3;
Prov 7:4
לַבִּינָה, Job 39:17
בַּבִּינָה (but never הַבִּינָה); Prov 2:2; Prov 2:3
לַתְּבוּנָה (but הַתְּבוּנָה only 1Kgs 7:14 emphatic); to perish
בַּצָּמָא

Judg 15:18

+;
Isa 29:21

בַּתֹּהוּ, Isa 32:19
בַּשִּׁפְּלָה תִּשְׁפַּל הָעִיר German in die Niedrigkeit sinkt die
Stadt,
Isa 45:16

together they go בַכְּלִמָּה (in die Schmach), Isa 46:2
בַּשְּׁבִי into captivity, Isa 47:5
בֹּאִי בַחשֶׁךְ (so always: never בְחשׁך). The living language may have
used
the
article more readily after a preposition, where it did not lengthen the word by an entire syll.; still the
disparity
of usage between α and β makes it not improbable that the article in β is
in
many
cases not original but due to the punctuators.

i. to mark the vocative
:
1Sam 17:55

חֵינֿפשׁך הַמֶּלֶךְ as thy soul liveth, O king, I do not know, 1Sam 17:58

בן מי אתה הַנַּעַר Whose son art thou, lad ?
2Sam 14:4
Help,
O king ! 1Kgs 18:26
הַבַּעַל עֲנֵנוּ, 2Kgs 9:5

הַדּֿוֺר אַתֶּם רְאוּ וג, Ezek 37:4
הָעֲצָמוֺת הַיְּבֵשׁוֺת
O dry bones, Mal 3:9
הַגּוֺי כֻּלּוֺ (Dr^§ 198^
Obs. 2).

[Note]

N.B. In poetry, the article is frequently dispensed with before words which
would
naturally take it in prose: thus Ps 2:2; Ps 2:8; Ps 2:10 & often אֶרֶץ; Ps 8:9; Ps 18:10; Ps 33:6 + שָׁמַיִם
;
(rarely in
prose, Gen 1:8;

2. With adjectives, participles, and demonstrative pronouns
(הוא, היא, המה, הם,
זה
, זאת, אלה): namely

a. (so regularly) when
the
substantive qualified by these words is defined by it likewise, as המלך הגדול
= ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ μέγας, Gen 2:12
הארץ ההוא, Gen 20:1
הַדָּבָר הַזֶּה, Josh 2:3
האנשׁים
הבאים אליך = οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ ἐλθόντες πρὸς σέ, Gen 13:5; Gen 16:13; Gen 24:65
; Gen 32:21
; Judg 6:28
; Isa 65:3
; Isa 65:4
; Isa 65:5
; Isa
66:24;
Ps 31:9. So
also with adjectives & participles,
if the substantive be defined by a suffix (as Deut 4:37
בְּכֹחוֺ הַגָּדֹל, 1Sam 8:14
זֵיתֵיכֶם הַטֹּבוֺת); and with a pronoun, if it be defined by a genitive (as Deut 29:20
;
1Sam 14:29
;
1Sam 15:14
;
2Kgs 6:32
בֶןהַֿמְּרַצֵּחַ הַזֶּה
this son of a murderer), but not if it be defined by a suffix, as Exod 10:1
אֹתֹתַי אֵלֶּה (not אתתי הָאֵלָּה), Josh 2:14
דְבָרֵנוּ זֶה
this our word (not הַזֶּה
׳
ד): see Dr^§ 209^
Obs. Similarly when the article with the participle has a resumptive

force, Ps
33:15

(Ps 14, he
looketh
forth from the place, &c.), הַיֹּצֵר יַחַד לִבָּם
he that formeth, etc., Ps 19:11
הַנֶּחֱמָדִים מִזָּהָב
which (Ps 10 b) are more desirable than gold, Ps 49:7. (:6
b
the iniquity of my
aggressors surroundeth me), הַבֹּטְחִים
who trust in their riches, etc., Gen 49:21; Isa 46:6; Isa 51:20; Job 6:16 + (see Dr^§ 135. 7^
).

b. (rare) when the substantive qualified by the adjective or participle was
felt to
be sufficiently definite for its own article to be dispensed with, as sometimes with the word day

Gen 1:31
יום השׁשׁי,
Gen 2:3
יום השׁביעי, Exod 12:15; Exod 12:18; Exod 20:10 (= Deut 5:14) Lev 19:6; Lev 22:27: so with

all living souls, Gen 1:28

Jer 17:2;
Zech 4:7;
Ps 104:18
;
Ezra 10:9
חֹדֶשׁ הַתְּשִׁיעִי (quite exceptional in OT). (With pronouns this use is so rare that,
where
it
occurs, it is dubious if the text be sound: 1Sam 17:12; 1Sam 17:17; Jer 40:3

Kt

Mic 7:11).
And
with the participle:
1Sam 25:10
רַבִּים עֲבָדִים הַמִּתְפָּֽרְצִים many are the slaves who break away etc., Isa 7:20;
Jer 27:3;
Jer 46:16

50:16
חֶרֶב
הַיּוֺנָה the oppressing sword, Ezek 2:3 (but

ᵐ5

Co omit הגוים), Ezek 14:22; Ezek 32:22
;
Ezek 32:24
; Ps 62:4;
Prov 26:18

; Judg 21:19
(very
anomalous, read probably לַמְּסִלָּה). This usage is somewhat more frequently in the later
parts of
OT; and in Post-Biblical Hebrew it is very general (e.g. יֵצֶד הָרַע the evil inclination):
see
further Dr^§ 209.^

c. with the participle, where the participle with the article forms really the

subject:
Gen 2:11

פִּי הַמְדַבֵּר my mouth is that which speaketh, Deut 3:21

According to the punctuation, it occurs similarly elsewhere, as Gen 18:21
הַשָבּאָה (so Gen 46:27; Job 2:11), Job 21:3
הַנּוֺלַדלֿוֺ, 1Kgs 11:9 & Dan 8:1
הַנִּרְאָה, Isa 51:10
הַשָּׂ֨מָה֨, Isa 56:3
הַנִּלְוָה, Ruth 1:22; Ruth 2:6; Ruth 4:3 (all הַשָּׁ֫בָה): but in all these passages, the
change
of
a point, or even sometimes of an accent, would restore the normal participial construction (as
הַבָּשָאה
, הַנּוֺלָד לוֺ compare Gen 48:5, הַנִּרְאֶה), which is, no doubt, what
was
intended by the original writers, and is recognised elsewhere by the Masora, e.g. Gen 12:7; Gen 35:1
הַנִּרְאֶה, Gen 46:26 & Ruth 4:11
הַבָּאָ֣ה (compare Ew^§ 331 b^
Ges^138, 3 b^). Once, still more anomalously, before a
preposition
1Sam 9:24
וְהֶעָלֶיהָ (as though καὶ τὸ ἐπ’
αὐτῆς): but read probably וְהָאַלְיָה
and the fat tail, see Dr. (In Arabic
[placeholder1225: Placeholders/1225.gif] also occurs, though very rarely, as a relative: W^AG
i. §
CG
117^). — On the anomalous use of the article with a word in the stative
construct
, see Grammars, as Ew^§ 290 d^, Ges^«GKC:127»§ 127^ R. 4, also
Dr^§
190-1^.
