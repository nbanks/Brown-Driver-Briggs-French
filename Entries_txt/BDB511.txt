a.
construction (see more fully Dr^§ 136-138, 143^
Friedrich^Die Hebr. Condit. sätze 1884^):

(1) with imperfect (continued by
perfects &
waw consecutive; apodosis usually begins with perfect & waw consecutive or bare imperfect; or, if
necessary,
with imperative or jussive) (a) of future
time: Gen
18:26
אִםאֶֿמְצָא if I shall find 50 righteous in Sodom, וְנָשָׂאתִי I will
pardon,
etc., Gen 24:8
; Gen
32:9
;

Deut 1:52
b
1Kgs 6:12

; Ps
89:31
;
Gen
42:37; Judg 13:16; 1Kgs 1:52 a Ps 132:12.
(b) of past time (rare, but classical):
Gen 31:8
אִם יאֹמַר
if everhe said . . . וְיָָֽלְדִוּ
then they used to bear, etc., Exod 40:37 & in the
protestations
Job 31:7; Job 31:13; Job 31:16; Job 31:25 etc.
(alternating with pff., see below, & with jussives in apodosis)
(c) assuming a
purely
imaginary case (with imperfect in both clauses, like the double optative in Greek), if,
though:

Gen 13:16
so
that אִםיֿוּכַל
if a man were able to number the stars, thy seed also

יִמָּנֶה

might be numbered, Num 22:18; Isa 1:18
כַּשָּׁנִים יַלְבִּינוּ
׳
אִםיִֿהְיוּ ח
though your sins were as scarlet, they should

become white as snow,
Amos 9:2-4
אִםיַֿחְתְּרוּ
though they were to dig into Sheôl, from thence
תִּקָּחֵם

would my hand fetch them, Ps 27:3; Ps 139:8 +.

(2) with participle
(expressing
either a present process,
or an approaching future: apodosis as 1.a.) Gen 24:42; Gen 24:49
; Judg 6:36
; Judg
9:15;
Judg 11:9

אִם מְשִׁיבִים אַתֶּם if ye are going to bring me back . . . ׳

(3)
with perfect (a) of future or
present
time
(continued by perfects & waw consecutive: apodosis as (1)
(a)) Gen 43:9
אִםלֹֿא הֲבִיאֹתִיו אֵלֶיךָ וְהִצַּגְתִּיו לְפָנֶיךָ if I do not bring him back (si eum
non
reduxero) and set him before thee, I will be guilty for ever, Gen 47:6
if thou knowest that there are men of worth among them

וְשַׂמְתָּם then make them, etc., Judg 16:17; 2Sam 15:33; 2Kgs 7:4;
Ps 41:7

94:18; Job
7:4;
Job 9:30f. Job 10:14

אִם חָטָאתִי וּשְׁמַרְתָּ֑נִי if I sin, thou watchest me. On אִםנָֿא
Gen 18:3
and
elsewhere see
נָא
. (b) of past time, whether (α
) in
actual
fact, or (β) in an assumed case (the perfect is here continued by the
imperfect
and
waw
consecutive; apodosis begins as before). (a)
Judg 9:16-19

אִם ֗֗֗ עֲשִׂיתֶם
if ye have done honestly וַתַּמְלִיכוּ
and have made Abimelech king . . ., 1Sam 26:19 especially in protestations,
as
Ps 7:4
אִם עָשִׂיתִי זאת
if I have done this . . ., let the enemy pursue my soul, etc. Jer 33:25
f.;
Job 31:5f;
Job 31:9
,
etc. (b)

Num
5:27

if she have defiled herself וַתִּמְעֹל
and been faithless, וּבָאוּ
then shall they come, etc., Num 15:24; Num 35:22-24. (c) with
bare perfect in
apodosis, in sense of If … had …, only Deut 32:30

אִםלֹֿא כִּי
were it not that …, Ps 73:15. (לוּ is
more
usual in
such cases.)

(4) with infinitive once (si vera 1.) Job 9:27
אִם אָמְרִי = if I say (literally if (there is) my saying). — Note that the verb
following

אִם is often strengthened by the infinitive absolute, as Exod 15:26; Exod 19:5
;
Exod 21:5
;
Exod 22:3
;
Exod
22:12

of
imprecation being omitted) becomes an emphatic negative, and אִםלֹֿא an emphatic
affirmative:

by thy life אִםאֶֿעֱשֶׂה אֶתהַֿדָּבָר הַזֶּה (may God bring all manner of evil
