Biblical Hebrew

אישׁ, אושׁ (Stem assumed in Thes for
אִישׁ; existence & meaning somewhat dubious Thes
(Add) & most derive אִישׁ from [אִנְשְׁ] √ אנשׁ (q. v.) In
favour are plural אֲנָשִׁים, feminine אִשָּׁה = [אִנְשָׁה], lack
of proven √ אישׁ, & lack of clear parallels for אישׁ in cognate languages.
Against the derivation of אִישׁ from inš is the vocalization (ִ  י
, and that fully written, not ֵ), maintained even with suffixes, the (rare) plural
אִישִׁים, the impossibility of deriving אִישׁ & אִשָּׁה from
same √ (אִשָּׁה from
