priests; elsewhere only in Chronicles: 2Chr 29:21; 2Chr 29:23; 2Chr 29:24 Hezekiah had made a ׳

ח of 7 צְפִירֵי
עִזִּים at purification of temple; Ezra 8:35 12 צְפִירֵי
׳
ח were offered; Neh 10:34
׳
ח || עולות; — in these no evidence of special ritual. Sin-offering
elsewhere
only in codes of
H
Ezekiel and
P
. — On Hos
4:8
see
1. above In
H
, Lev
23:19
a שׂעיר עזים, for feast of weeks. In Ezekiel ׳
ח in general || other sacrifices, Ezek 40:39; Ezek 45:17; Ezek 45:25; Ezek 46:20 and priests eat
them Ezek 42:13
;
Ezek 44:29
.
At dedication of altar, the blood of a young bullock was to be applied to horns of altar, the corners of its
settle
and its border, the bullock itself burnt without the sanctuary; for each of the 7 days following a שׂעיר
עזים was to be offered Ezek 43:19; Ezek 43:21; Ezek 43:22; Ezek 43:25. On first day of first month a
young
bullock was to offered to cleanse the sanctuary: its blood put on the door posts of the house and of the gate of
the
inner court an on the four corners of the settle of the altar; also on the seventh day (

ᵐ5

first day of seventh month) Ezek 45:17; Ezek 45:19 (compare Ezek 45:18 Ezek 45:20). On 14th day of first
month the prince was to offer a bullock for himself and the people and on each of the 7 days of the Passover
week a
שׂעיר עזים
Ezek 45:22
;
Ezek 45:23
.
When a priest entered the sanctuary to minister after his cleaning he was to offer his sin-offering Ezek 44:27
.

P
gives several grades:
a. a ruler should offer a he-goat Lev 4:24; Lev 4:25; Num 7:16; Num 7:22; Num 7:28; Num 7:34; Num 7:40; Num 7:46; Num 7:52; Num 7:58; Num 7:64; Num 7:70; Num 7:76; Num 7:82; Num 7:87 an ordinary person a she-goat
Lev 4:29
(compare v
Lev 4:28) Lev 5:6; Num 15:27,
ewe
lamb Lev 4:32;
Lev 4:33 (twice
in
verse); Lev 4:34
;
Lev 14:19;
Num 6:14; Num 6:16, a
turtle
dove or young pigeon Lev
5:7
; Lev 5:8;
Lev 5:9 (twice in
verse);
Lev 12:6; Lev 12:8; Lev 14:22;
Lev 14:31;
Lev 15:15;
Lev 15:30;
Num 6:11, or
one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour Lev 5:11 (twice in verse); Lev 5:12 according to ability of the person, and nature of
offence. The
victim was brought unto the tent of meeting, the hands of the offerer laid on its head, it was slaughtered by
the
offerer, the priest took some of the blood and put it on horns of altar of burnt-offering and the rest of the
blood
he poured out at the base of it, to cover over the sin, or cleanse the altar from the sin defiling it. All the
fat
pieces (compare Lev
4:22
; Lev 4:35
)
and a handful of the flour (compare Lev 5:12) were burned on altar. The rest of the flesh and the flour were eaten
by
priests in court of Holy place Lev 5:13; Lev 6:10; Lev 6:18 (twice in verse); Lev 6:23 (compare v.Lev 6:11 v.Lev 6:19), Lev 7:7; Lev 10:16; Lev 10:17; Lev 10:19 (twice in verse);
Lev 14:13;
Num 18:9.

b. a
bullock was offered for priests Exod 29:14; Exod 29:36; Lev 4:3; Lev 4:8; Lev 4:20; Lev 8:2; Lev 8:14 (twice in verse); Lev 9:2; Lev 9:7; Lev 9:8; Lev 9:10 for Levites at their installation Num 8:8; Num 8:12 and for
whole congregation Lev
4:14; Lev
4:21 but usually
offering for congregation was he-goat Num 15:24; Num 15:25, especially at dedication of altar Lev 9:3; Lev 9:15; Lev 9:22. and in ritual of feasts Num 28:15;
Num 28:22;
Num 28:30;
Num 29:5; Num 29:11;
Num 29:16;
Num 29:19;
Num 29:22;
Num 29:25;
Num 29:28;
Num 29:31;
Num 29:34;
Num 29:38.
Before
consecration of the tabernacle the blood went to altar of burnt-offering (Lev 9:9), but subsequently some of it was sprinkled
seven times before the vail and some of it put on horns of altar of incense to cleanse this higher altar; the
fast
pieces were burned on altar of burnt-offering, and the rest of the victim burned without the camp (Lev 4:3-21; Lev 6:23; Lev 8:16; Lev 8:17; Lev 9:10; Lev 9:11).

c. on day of atonement, sin-offering for high priest was a bullock Lev 16:3; Lev 16:6 and for congregation two
he-goats, one לַעֲזָאזֵל (see
עזאזל
) Lev 16:5

(compare Lev 16:8
v
Lev 16:10 v
Lev 16:20 v
Lev 16:22),
the
other for sacrifice ליהוה
Lev 16:9
(compare v
Lev 16:8). Some
of
the blood of Aaron's bullock was first taken into innermost sanctuary and sprinkled on the כפרת
and
seven times before it; so also blood of the he-goat Lev 16:11 (twice in verse); Lev 16:15 (compare Lev 16:12-14 Lev 16:16 v
Lev 16:17)
to cleanse highest
altar: then the blood of the two victims was applied to lower altars as in a. and
b
. and so sin was covered over at the three altars Exod 30:10 (compare Lev 16:16-19). The fat pieces went
to altar of
burnt-offering and the rest of the victims was burnt without the camp Lev 16:25; Lev 16:27 (twice in verse). (Sins
which might be
covered over were limited to those committed בשׁגגה
Lev 4:2; Lev 4:22; Lev 4:27; Num 15:27,
לשׁגגה
Num 15:24,
minor
offences Lev 5:1-6
and
ceremonial uncleanness Lev
12:6; Lev
12:8
; Lev 14:13
; Lev 15:15
; Num 6:11
;
Num 6:14.) —
