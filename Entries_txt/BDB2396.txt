Biblical Hebrew

III. זמר (√ of following; meaning dubious; DHM in MV^10, 983^ compare Arabic
[placeholder1510: Placeholders/1510.gif]
thing to be protected, thing sacred, inviolable,
Lane^978^, Sabean דֿמר
protect; Aramaic
[placeholder1511: Placeholders/1511.gif]
wonder at, admire,
[placeholder1512: Placeholders/1512.gif]
mirus, admirabilis, etc.; hence זמרת
Gen 43:11 'die
Merkwürdigkeiten des Landes').
Arabic
[placeholder1513: Placeholders/1513.gif] is urge with chiding, reproof,
[placeholder1514: Placeholders/1514.gif]
thing involving blame (if not protected, defended); this hardly supports meaning
choice products for III. זִמְרָה.
